Kurdish security forces have been trying to stem the IS advance across Iraq's northern Nineveh province
What the Kassig video tells us
Kurdish forces in northern Iraq are claiming their biggest victory yet against Islamic State (IS) militants.
They say they have broken the IS siege of Mount Sinjar, where thousands of Yazidis and other displaced Iraqis have been trapped since August.
IS controls a swathe of Iraq and Syria, where it has declared a caliphate.
Meanwhile, the Pentagon's top officer says US air strikes have killed several high-ranking military leaders of IS in Iraq.
The Kurdish offensive against IS forces besieging Mount Sinjar began early on Wednesday with the most intensive round of air strikes yet by US and coalition forces - 45 in all.

Thousands of Yazidi and other displaced Iraqis have fled violence in the town of Sinjar
On the ground, about 8,000 Kurdish peshmerga fighters launched a two-pronged attack which they said had succeeded in opening a wide corridor to allow members of the Yazidi minority and others to leave.
Masrur Barzani, Chancellor of the Kurdistan Region Security Council, said the operation had been to advance from Zumar - which Kurdish forces recaptured in October - to Mount Sinjar and to rescue the Yazidi people trapped there.
""It was a very big operation and thankfully it was concluded very successfully,"" he said.
Peshmerga commanders said they expected the evacuation of those trapped on the mountain to begin on Friday.
A statement from the Kurdish command said large numbers of militant fighters had fled westwards into Syria or eastwards towards Mosul, which they captured in June.
The peshmerga also said eight villages had been recaptured and about 80 militants killed in the offensive.
The BBC's Jim Muir says that if the Kurds have done all they say, it is a significant advance.
But he adds that there is still a long way to go - the town of Sinjar itself, to the south of the mountain, remains in IS hands, as do Mosul and the nearby town of Tal Afar.
IS captured the town of Sinjar in August forcing thousands of residents, mainly from the Yazidi sect, to flee. Many were airlifted off the nearby mountain but thousands more who came later found themselves trapped.
'High-value targets'
The attack on Sinjar was one of the reasons the US began air strikes against IS positions in Iraq in August. It expanded its air campaign into Syria the following month.
Martin Dempsey: ""These are high-value targets, senior leadership""
Gen Martin Dempsey, chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff, said the air strikes that had killed the IS leaders were designed to hamper the Islamist group's ability to conduct attacks, supply fighters and finance operations.
Gen Dempsey told the Wall Street Journal that the loss of IS leaders was ""disruptive to their planning and command and control"".
He added: ""These are high-value targets, senior leadership.""
Pentagon officials said that between 3 and 9 December, US air strikes killed Abd al-Basit, head of IS military operations in Iraq, and Haji Mutazz, a key aide of IS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.
They added that in late November another strike killed Radwin Talib, IS governor of the northern Iraqi city of Mosul.
Other defence officials said a number of senior and mid-level IS commanders had also died in air strikes, and that they believed this was beginning to significantly weaken the group's leadership structure.

Murray Street in the Manoora suburb of Cairns has been closed off by police
Eight children have been found dead at a house in Cairns in northern Queensland, say Australian police.
Police said a 34-year-old woman had been taken to hospital with stab wounds but was stable.
The details of the incident and the woman's relationship to the children, aged between 18 months and 15 years, are not yet clear.
Australian reports say the children were stabbed but police have not confirmed this.
Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott said in a statement it was an ""unspeakable crime"", and that all parents would feel ""gut-wrenching sadness at what has happened"".
Bruno Asnicar of Cairns Police said that the scenes his officers had witnessed were ""extremely distressing""
The house in the Manoora suburb has been cordoned off and detectives are searching the yard.
Police have said it was a ""tragic event"" but there was no cause for public concern.
They have not made any arrests, but said the injured woman was assisting with their investigations.
The BBC's Jon Donnison in Sydney says it appears police are not looking for any suspects.
Police have been comforting shocked local residents outside the house
The Australian Associated Press news agency quoted a woman as saying she was the injured woman's cousin and that the children were siblings.
Cairns Detective Inspector Bruno Asnicar told reporters he could not confirm whether the children were from the same family.
He said police currently believed there were eight children involved but ""that may go up or down"" as the house was searched.
""These events are extremely distressing for everyone, of course, and police officers aren't immune to that, we're human beings as well,"" he said.
AAP reporter Cleo Lane at the scene told the BBC residents were standing in the street in shock.
Queensland Police said in a statement earlier that they were called to a residence in Murray Street at 11.20 local time (01:20 GMT) following reports of a woman with serious injuries.
""During an examination of the residence police located the bodies of the children, all aged between 18 months and 15 years,"" said the statement.
Queensland Premier Campbell Newman said he was ""deeply saddened and shocked"" by the events.
""Indeed, the whole Cairns community and the people of Queensland will feel the effects of this tragedy, particularly at a time of year when families come together.""

The Interview stars Seth Rogen and James Franco as journalists enlisted to kill Kim Jong-un
Sony scraps The Interview worldwide Watch
A cyber attack on Sony Pictures that forced the cancellation of a major film release is being seen as a serious national security matter, the US says.
A White House spokesman said the US believed the hacking was the work of a ""sophisticated actor"" - but refused to confirm if North Korea was responsible.
Sony withdrew The Interview, a new comedy film about North Korea's leader, after threats from hackers.
Hackers have already released sensitive information stored on Sony computers.
They later issued a warning to members of the public planning to see The Interview.
Referring to the 11 September 2001 terror attacks, they said ""the world will be full of fear"" if the film was screened.
Ex-hacker Marc Maiffret: 'It's easy to break into companies like Sony'
Team America 'pulled'
Three cinemas said replacement screenings of Team America, a film which ridicules the former North Korean leader Kim Jong-il, had also been cancelled.
The Plaza Atlanta and Ohio's Capitol Theatre both tweeted their screenings had been cancelled by the film's makers Paramount Pictures, while the Alamo Drafthouse said the film had been ""removed from release"". Paramount has declined to comment.
Many cinemas scrapped plans to show The Interview, and Sony then cancelled the release of the film altogether - moves criticised in Hollywood as an attack on the freedom of expression.
At a White House briefing on Thursday, spokesman Josh Earnest said US officials had held daily discussions about the Sony cyber attack and were considering an ""appropriate response"".
However, he refused to comment on who was responsible, saying he did not wish to pre-empt an investigation by the Department of Justice and the FBI.

The Interview, made by Sony Pictures, features James Franco and Seth Rogen as two journalists who are granted an audience with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un.
The CIA then enlists the pair to assassinate him. The film was due to have been released over Christmas.
'Righteous deed'
In November, a cyber attack crippled computers at Sony and led to upcoming films and workers' personal data being leaked online.
The hackers also released salary details and social security numbers for thousands of Sony employees - including celebrities.
Earlier this month, North Korea denied hacking into Sony's computers - but praised the attack itself as a ""righteous deed"".
An article on North Korea's state-run KCNA news agency, quoting the country's top military body, said suggestions that Pyongyang was behind the attack were ""wild rumour"".
However, it warned the US that ""there are a great number of supporters and sympathisers"" of North Korea ""all over the world"" who may have carried out the attack.
In the article, Sony Pictures was accused of ""abetting a terrorist act"" and ""hurting the dignity of the supreme leadership"" of North Korea by producing the movie.

"4","EU needs 'long-term' Russia strategy","The European Union needs a ""plan for years"" towards Russia, Donald Tusk says, chairing his first summit as European Council president.","EU needs 'long-term' Russia strategy, says Donald Tusk
Donald Tusk, the former Polish prime minister, is the new president of the European Council
The EU needs a long-term strategy on Russia instead of simply reacting to events, the new EU summit chairman Donald Tusk has said.
Mr Tusk said he had been ""really moved"" by the leaders' discussion of the Ukraine crisis.
Earlier, the EU tightened sanctions against Russia over its support for armed separatists in eastern Ukraine.
""We need a plan for years… we're not too optimistic, we have to be realistic,"" Mr Tusk said.
""Russia is our strategic problem, not Ukraine,"" said Mr Tusk, the former Polish Prime Minister. ""The biggest challenge is Russia's approach not only to Ukraine but also to Europe.
""Our discussion [on Ukraine at dinner] showed Europe united as never before. Russia's behaviour needs a pragmatic solution, a united, common position.""
Poland, bordering on Ukraine, has long had tense relations with Russia, and is among the most vocal critics of Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Crimea targeted
Pro-Russian rebels in eastern Ukraine still have heavy weapons including tanks and rockets, despite demands by Ukraine and the West for them to disarm. Continuing clashes in the Donetsk region have undermined peace efforts.
Under the latest measures against Russia, all EU tour operators will be barred from operating in Crimea and European investment there will be banned. Russia annexed Crimea in March.
Italy's Prime Minister Matteo Renzi said ""we must work with Russia to push it out of Ukraine"".
Fighting continues in eastern Ukraine, despite appeals by the EU
And EU Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker stressed that the EU's channels of communication with Russia must remain open.
There was much surprise among the summit journalists that Mr Tusk managed to reduce the expected two-day summit to one afternoon and evening. Usually EU summits go on hours longer than planned, often into the early morning.
Investment plan
The other main topic was Mr Juncker's plan to generate €315bn (£250bn; $392bn) of private investment for infrastructure projects in the EU.
It got the leaders' approval, and the aim is to launch it next June.
Mr Juncker said the commission would ""look favourably"" on government participation in big investment schemes, and would ""neutralise"" national contributions to the new fund. That suggests more lenient deficit targets for governments that boost investment.
Italy, burdened by colossal debts and high unemployment, warmly welcomed the Juncker plan.
Mr Renzi said investment decisions would involve ""politicians, not only technocrats"" and he stressed that for years Italy had been urging flexibility in reaching budget targets set by the commission.
""Growth and not only austerity is the legacy of the Italian presidency [of the EU],"" he said.
He and French President Francois Hollande - both centre-left leaders  - have urged Germany and other pro-austerity states to encourage much-needed growth, by allowing a monetary stimulus in the eurozone.

"5","US Secret Service is too 'insular'","The agency guarding the US president is too insular and must recruit its next head externally, a review prompted by a White House security breach says.","Insular US Secret Service needs external boss - report
The White House is meant to be one of the most secure sites in the US
White House security lapses detailed
The US Secret Service, which guards the US president, is too insular and must recruit its next head externally, a review prompted by a White House security breach says.
The report, a summary of which was released by the Homeland Security Department, said the agency needed more plainclothes and uniformed staff.
It added that the White House needed a new, taller fence.
The review came after an intruder with a knife entered the building.
Omar Gonzalez, a former US soldier, was apprehended deep inside the presidential residence in September after he had scaled a fence around the building and evaded several guards - including one with an attack dog.
Julia Pearson, the Secret Service director at the time, resigned partly as a result of this breach.
The Secret Service is tasked with guarding the US president, as well as several senior government officials.
According to an executive summary of the independent review, the agency's next director ""will have to make difficult choices, identifying clear priorities for the organisation and holding management accountable for any failure to achieve those priorities"".
The Secret Service director at the time, Julia Pierson, has since resigned
""Only a director from outside the [Secret] Service, removed from organisational traditions and personal relationships, will be able to do the honest top-to-bottom reassessment this will require.""
The review also said a better fence should be built ""as soon as possible"", recommending one that was several feet higher and curved outwards, making it harder to scale.
However, the review noted that the problems in the agency ""go deeper than a new fence can fix"". The panel said the agency's staff were over-stretched, working ""an unsustainable number of hours"".
It called for boosting the service's ranks by 85 special agents and 200 uniformed officers, to reduce overtime and allow staff to receive regular training.
The four-member panel based its findings on interviews with 50 employees of the Secret Service. The panel admitted that many of its recommendations had been made before - but not implemented.
Many details have already emerged of the security lapses that allowed Mr Gonzalez to enter the White House, pointing to a lack of training, bad staffing decisions and failures in communication.
Mr Obama and his family were not at the White House when the intrusion happened, having departed about 10 minutes earlier by helicopter.
Mr Gonzalez has been indicted on charges including unlawfully entering a restricted building or grounds while carrying a deadly or dangerous weapon and unlawful possession of ammunition.
The intrusion came after a series of embarrassing lapses by the Secret Service - including reports that agents had used prostitutes while on duty in Colombia.
A new barrier was erected following the security breach

Palestinians want an end to Jewish settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem
Simmering city
Israel says a Palestinian effort to set a three-year deadline for it to end its occupation of Palestinian territories is a ""gimmick"".
A draft resolution, submitted by Jordan to the UN Security Council, also calls for a peace accord within a year.
Israeli Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman said that without Israel's consent, nothing would change.
Jordan has indicated it will not seek a quick vote, opening the way for further discussion.
The US - which has vetoed previous resolutions it considers hostile to its ally Israel - said on Thursday it would not support the move.
US State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said they would not support any action that would prejudge the outcome of negotiations.
""We have seen the draft, it is not something we would support and we think others feel the same and are calling for further consultations,"" she said.
Mr Lieberman said the draft resolution would only deepen the conflict.
Settlement building has led to clashes between Israeli forces and Palestinian protesters
""Certainly this will not hasten an agreement because without Israel's consent, nothing will change,"" he said.
""It would be better if the Security Council dealt with matters truly important to the citizens of the world, such as the murderous attacks this week in Australia and Pakistan... and not waste time on the Palestinians' gimmicks.""
Despite Israel's objections, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas said he would pursue consultations ""with brothers and friends"" at the UN.
The draft text says a negotiated solution should be based on several parameters including the boundary between Israel and the West Bank that existed before the 1967 Six Day War, security agreements and ""Jerusalem as the shared capital of the two states"".
It urges both parties ""to abstain from any unilateral and illegal actions, including settlement activities, that could undermine the viability of a two-state solution"".
Another draft resolution, being put together by France, is expected to call for a return to talks on a final treaty with the aim of achieving a two-state solution to the conflict within two years.
It does not mention an Israeli withdrawal, but does lay out some of the parameters of a permanent peace deal.
Direct peace talks between Israel and the Palestinians brokered by the US collapsed in April.

Boko Haram has taken control of several towns and villages in the north-east
Militants have stormed a remote village in north-eastern Nigeria, killing at least 33 people and kidnapping about 200, a survivor has told the BBC.
He said that suspected Boko Haram militants had seized young men, women and children from Gumsuri village.
The attack happened on Sunday but news has only just emerged, after survivors reached the city of Maiduguri.
Meanwhile, Cameroon's army says it has killed 116 Nigerian militants who had attacked one of its bases, AFP reports.
After killing our youths, the insurgents have taken away our wives and daughters”
End Quote Gumsuri resident
The state of Borno has seen at least two militant attacks over the past few days.
Residents told the BBC that armed militants attacked the border town of Amchide on Wednesday, arriving in two vehicles with many others on foot.
They raided the market area, setting fire to shops and more than 50 houses.
No group has said it carried out either attack but officials have blamed Boko Haram militants.
More than 2,000 people have been killed in militant violence this year alone, mostly in north-eastern Nigeria, near the border with Cameroon.
Analysis: Will Ross, BBC News, Lagos
This is yet another abduction on a staggering scale - one of the worst since the Chibok girls were seized in April.
It might seem surprising that it has taken four days for news of the killings and abductions to break.
That points to just how dangerous that area of north-east Nigeria still is despite promises of a massive military deployment there.
Gumsuri is about 70km (43 miles) from Maiduguri, the state capital, but survivors had to travel hundreds of kilometres via a circuitous route to avoid areas overrun with jihadists in order to reach the city and alert people to the horrors they had witnessed.
The vigilantes in the same village had reportedly fought off Boko Haram before but this time they were overpowered.
There has been no word from the military or the government and you have to wonder whether in any other country in the world such a horrific event could take place without a single word from the authorities.
The villagers who were kidnapped on Sunday were from Gumsuri, not Bintiri, as was earlier reported by the BBC.
The survivor of the Gumsuri attack said that he returned to the village and helped bury 33 bodies after the violence.
He said he went from house-to-house to ascertain how many people were missing.
While initial reports put the number of kidnapped at 100, it was actually double that, the survivor said.
His testimony was confirmed to BBC Hausa by a local official. Neither person wanted their names published.
Meanwhile, Reuters and AFP news agencies quoted residents as saying that at least 185 people had been abducted.
'Wives and daughters' taken
A vigilante group that had protected the village from previous attacks was overpowered by the militants, AFP reported.
""After killing our youths, the insurgents have taken away our wives and daughters,"" a resident who fled to Maiduguri was quoted as saying.
In Cameroon, the army said vehicles from its elite battalion had been caught in an ambush on Wednesday.
""At the same time... the Amchide military base was attacked by hundreds of fighters from the sect, but the response from our defence forces was instant and appropriate,"" the army said, according to AFP.
One Cameroonian soldier was killed and an officer is missing, it added.
Who are Boko Haram?
More than 200 schoolgirls were kidnapped by the group in April
Founded in 2002
Initially focused on opposing Western education - Boko Haram means ""Western education is forbidden"" in the Hausa language
Launched military operations in 2009 to create an Islamic state
Thousands killed, mostly in north-eastern Nigeria - also attacked police and UN headquarters in the capital, Abuja
Some three million people are affected
Declared a terrorist group by the US in 2013
Profile: Boko Haram leader Abubakar Shekau
Death penalty
On Wednesday a Nigerian court martial handed down death sentences to 54 soldiers who had refused to take part in an operation last August to recapture three towns overrun by the militants.
The soldiers, who were found guilty of mutiny, had complained that they did not have the weapons needed to take on the jihadists.
The soldiers appeared before a court martial in Abuja
Boko Haram has been waging an insurgency since 2009 and is seeking to create an Islamic state in north-eastern Nigeria.
Attacks have increased since three states - Borno, Adamawa and Yobe - were put under emergency rule more than 18 months ago.
The kidnapping of more than 200 schoolgirls from the town of Chibok in Borno state in April sparked international outrage.
Despite military assistance from countries such as China, France, the UK and the US, the girls have not yet been rescued.

Florida Senator Marco Rubio said President Obama had ""appeased the Castro brothers""
Opponents of President Barack Obama's new Cuba policy have threatened to block his efforts to restore diplomatic relations after 50 years of hostility.
Florida Senator Marco Rubio promised on CNN to block the nomination of any US ambassador to Cuba.
Other anti-Castro legislators suggested Congress would remove funding for any normalised ties with the country.
US-Cuban ties have been frozen since the early 1960s - a policy of isolation Mr Obama condemned as a failure.
On Wednesday, the US president said it was time for a new approach.
As part of the deal, US contractor Alan Gross, 65, and an unnamed intelligence officer loyal to the US were released from Cuban prison in return for three Cubans held in the US.
Analysis, Thomas Sparrow, BBC Mundo
Cubans react to the news
It is interesting to note that there is a marked contrast between Cuban Americans around the US, who tend to favour normal relations between the two countries, and leading Cuban American congressmen in Washington.
Senators Robert Menendez, a Democrat from New Jersey, and Marco Rubio, a Republican from Florida, have played very vocal roles in the Senate Foreign Relations committee, and they have both been very critical of President Obama's announcement yesterday.
Mr Rubio said he didn't care if ""99% of people in polls"" disagreed with his stance, a message that could resonate in Florida, the traditional home of the Cuban exile community but also a state that is increasingly becoming more diverse and less dominated by Cuban affairs.
Ultimately, comments like these come to show how so-called hardliners still have significant clout when it comes to preventing a new course in bilateral relations, even when common Cubans, especially younger generations, have moved on beyond these traditional views.
The US will now seek to set up an embassy in Cuba, expand US visitors to Cuba, open up banking and increase caps on how much cash Cubans can post to relatives on to the island.
But only Congress has the power to end the full trade embargo, and with many Republicans deeply opposed to such a change, correspondents say it is unlikely to happen soon.
Among those opposed to restoring diplomatic relations was Democratic Senator Robert Menendez who said he was ""deeply disappointed"".
President Raul Castro with three released convicted spies
""It's a fallacy to believe that Cuba will reform because an American president opens his hands and the Castro brothers will suddenly unclench their fists.""
Fellow Senator Lindsey Graham, a Republican, said he would be among those trying to pass legislation to undercut funding for policy changes, including setting up an embassy.
""Normalising relations with Cuba is a bad idea at a bad time,"" tweeted Mr Graham, who will become chairman of a committee that determines state department funding in January.
Republican Senator Marco Rubio slammed the deal as ""inexplicable"".
""Appeasing the Castro brothers will only cause other tyrants from Caracas to Tehran to Pyongyang to see that they can take advantage of President Obama's naivete during his final two years in office,"" Mr Rubio said in a statement.

Mr Rubio told CNN on Wednesday he reserved the right ""to do everything within the rules of the Senate to prevent that sort of individual from ever even coming up for a vote,"" referring to the confirmation process for ambassadors in relation to Cuba.
Their objections mirror the concerns of some dissident Cubans living in the US.
""It is a betrayal. The talks are only going to benefit Cuba,"" Carlos Munoz Fontanil said at a protest in Miami's Calle Ocho.
Despite this opposition by members of Congress like Mr Rubio and Mr Menendez, some analysts have preferred to stress that Mr Obama has considerable support in Congress.
Cynthia Arnson, director of the Latin America programme at the Wilson Center, told BBC Mundo that ""it is important to underscore that there are many Republicans who are not resisting this or are neutral"".
And Tomas Bilbao, executive director of the Cuba Study Group, a non-governmental organisation in Washington, highlighted the fact that the plane that brought Alan Gross back to the US had three members of Congress on board, including Republican Jeff Flake, from Arizona.
Officials said that Mr Obama and Mr Castro spoke by telephone on Tuesday for nearly an hour - the first presidential-level talks between the two nations since Cuba's 1959 revolution.
In exchange for Mr Gross, who was in poor health, and the unnamed intelligence officer, Washington released three members of the so-called ""Cuban Five"" who were serving lengthy sentences for espionage.
Mr Gross's five-year imprisonment had undermined previous attempts to thaw diplomatic relations between the two countries.

The US has carried out numerous drone strikes against the Taliban
The removal of senior Taliban leaders has had little impact on the organisation, a CIA report released by Wikileaks has said .
The 2009 report analyses ""high value targeting"" in a number of conflicts - the assassination of senior insurgents.
It said the Taliban's ability to replace lost leaders has hampered the effectiveness of coalition operations against its leadership.
The CIA would not comment on the leaked documents.
The report, which Wikileaks describes as ""pro-assassination"", looks at the pros and cons of ""high value targeting"" (HVT) programmes.
As well as examining recent actions in Iraq and Afghanistan, the report assesses British action in Northern Ireland, Sri Lankan operations against Tamil Tigers and French efforts during the Algerian civil war, among others.
Benefits of HVT operations, according to the report, include ""eroding insurgent effectiveness, weakening insurgent will and reducing the level of insurgent support"".
Potential negatives include ""strengthening an armed group's bond with the population"" and ""radicalising an insurgent group's remaining leaders"".
On Afghanistan, the report said that targeting senior Taliban figures has been constrained by problems connecting it to broader Afghan and Nato efforts against the organisation.
It also says the Taliban has ""good succession planning and bench strength, especially at the middle levels"".
Since the report was written, President Obama has increased drone strikes in north-west Pakistan, targeting Taliban and al-Qaeda leaders.
There have also been several strikes in Yemen.

UPP members, led by party leader Lee Jung-hee (centre), demonstrated against the decision on Friday
South Korea profile
South Korea has banned a political party for the first time in decades, with a court ordering a party accused of supporting the North to disband.
The government had petitioned the constitutional court last year to ban the leftist Unified Progressive Party, which has five members in parliament.
Some UPP members were previously arrested for plotting a rebellion.
The move has sparked concern about freedom of expression and association in South Korea.
The decision was closely watched by political groups, with hundreds gathered near the constitutional court in Seoul amid a tight security presence of about 1,000 riot police.
Both UPP supporters and its opponents held demonstrations, shouting slogans and waving signs, reports said.
It is the first time South Korea's constitutional court has banned a political party since it was established in 1988, said AP news agency.
Eight out of nine judges agreed on Friday to accept the government's petition to disband the UPP, order it to forfeit its seats in parliament and ban an equivalent party from forming.
Chief Judge Park Han-chul said ""there was an urgent need to remove the threat posed by the party to the basic order of democracy"".
Conservative groups gathered outside the constitutional court in Seoul called for the UPP's dissolution
Ban 'raises questions'
Justice Minister Hwan Kyo-ahn, making the government's final argument before the court last month, said the UPP has attempted to ""establish a pro-communist government and unification to realise North Korean-style socialism"".
But the UPP has said it only wants greater reconciliation with the North.
The government's petition was prompted by the arrest of several UPP members in 2013.
Seven members were eventually convicted of plotting to overthrow the South Korean government in the event war broke out with the North.
UPP's leader Lee Jung-hee told reporters on Friday that the decision ""opened a dark age with an authoritarian decision"" and had turned South Korea into a ""dictatorial country"".
Amnesty International's East Asia research director Roseann Rife said the ban ""raises serious questions as to the authorities' commitment to freedom of expression and association.""
""Security concerns must never be used as an excuse to deny people the right to express different political views,"" she said.

Speaking at his end-of-year news conference, which lasted over three hours, he blamed ""outside factors"" for the currency hitting an all-time low.
But he admitted Russia's central bank could have acted more swiftly.
Russia is on the verge of recession due to falling oil prices and sanctions over its role in the Ukraine crisis.
However, the president denied pursuing an ""aggressive"" foreign policy and accused the US and EU of conspiring to weaken Russia.

If the economic problems persisted, he said, the government would have to ""reduce social spending and future growth"".
But he added: ""Our economy will get out of this crisis. How long? Maybe two years, but after that, growth is inevitable.""
Although the rouble strengthened on Thursday morning, it has taken a battering in recent days.
The currency's collapse came after a drastic 6.5 percentage point rise in Russian interest rates to 17%.
Earlier this week, there were reports of Russians flocking to the shops to spend their cash before prices shoot back up. Many were said to be buying cars and home appliances.
Analysis: John Simpson, BBC News, Moscow
President Putin gave a bravura performance, speaking frankly without notes, and accepting questions even from Russian and foreign journalists known for their hostility to him.
He wanted to calm fears about the fall of the rouble, and about pensions and living standards. At worst, he said, the problem would last two years.
I asked him about Western fears that he was stoking up a new Cold War. Now the Russian currency was in trouble, I said, he might need Western help.
So I asked if he would take this opportunity to say he didn't want a Cold War and would work to solve the Ukraine problem. He answered at length - but it was noticeable he didn't take advantage of the opportunity to calm things down.

Mr Putin estimated that Western sanctions, put in place after Russia annexed Crimea from Ukraine in March, had accounted for roughly 25-30% of the rouble's troubles.
On Ukraine, President Putin said he was hopeful the conflict could be solved through peace talks.
He urged the Ukrainian government and pro-Russian rebels in the east of the country to conduct a quick ""all for all"" prisoner swap before Christmas.
Ukraine and the West accuse Mr Putin of sending Russian troops to fight with the rebels, but the Kremlin denies the allegations.

"12","Carbon mission returns global maps","Nasa's Orbiting Carbon Observatory produces its first global maps of carbon dioxide in Earth's atmosphere.","Carbon dioxide satellite mission returns first global maps
By Jonathan Amos Science correspondent, BBC News, San Francisco
The map contains 600,000 data points
Euro forest disturbances increasing
Nasa's Orbiting Carbon Observatory (OCO-2) has returned its first global maps of the greenhouse gas CO2.
The satellite was sent up in July to help pinpoint the key locations on the Earth's surface where carbon dioxide is being emitted and absorbed.
This should help scientists better understand how human activities are influencing the climate.
The new maps contain only a few weeks of data in October and November, but demonstrate the promise of the mission.
Clearly evident within the charts is the banding effect that describes how emitted gases are mixed by winds along latitudes rather than across them.
Also apparent are the higher concentrations over South America and southern Africa. These are likely the result of biomass burning in these regions.
It is possible to see spikes, too, on the eastern seaboard of the US and over China. These probably include the additional emissions of CO2 that come from industrialisation.
""We're very early into the mission and collecting data, yet as we show, we can take five weeks of that information and give you a quick picture of global carbon dioxide,"" said deputy project scientist Annmarie Eldering.
""It really suggests to us that OCO-2 will be very useful for finding out about where carbon dioxide is coming from and being taken back up around the globe,"" she told BBC News.
The US space agency researcher presented the maps here at the American Geophysical Union Fall Meeting in San Francisco.
Sources and sinks
The satellite was launched this year as a replacement for an earlier venture that was destroyed in 2009 when its rocket failed soon after lift-off.
OCO-2's key objective is to trace the global geographic distribution of CO2 in the atmosphere - measuring its presence down through the column of air to the planet's surface.
Scientists want to know how exactly the greenhouse gas cycles through the Earth system - the carbon cycle.
Humans add something like 40 billion tonnes of the gas to the atmosphere every year, principally from the burning of fossil fuels.
But the ultimate destination of this carbon dioxide is uncertain.  About half is thought to be absorbed into the oceans, with the rest pulled down into land ""sinks"".
It is hoped OCO-2 can describe those draw-down locations in much more detail.
Even with this snapshot, scientists can see that some of their existing models will have to be revised.
Artist's impression: The  OCO-2 satellite has an initial mission of two years
As part of its presentation, the observatory team showed off a special targeting mode that it can employ on OCO-2.
This involves swinging the satellite so that its spectrometer instrument can scan a restricted location in very high resolution.
Currently, these places are ones where the project has sophisticated ground equipment to gather measurements that can then validate OCO-2's observations from orbit.  But ultimately, the lessons learned could allow the mission to make detailed surveys at other sites, such as megacities known be big emitters.
""I think the answer to that is 'yes', and there are discussions going on now as to whether we can increase the number of places that we can target to look at other interesting locations.
""But more importantly, though, we are all hoping there will be a follow-on mission called OCO-3, which would directly provide that flexibility in operations.""
The Orbiting Carbon Observatory has been spoken of as the forerunner of satellite missions that would seek to gain the information needed to patrol climate treaties, by helping to check that promises made by nations on carbon curbs were being kept.

"13","New record depth for deepest fish","Fish are filmed more than 8,000m down in the Mariana Trench - the deepest place on Earth.","New record depth for deepest fish
By Rebecca Morelle Science Correspondent, BBC News, San Francisco
The fish moves in from the bottom-left of the image towards the baited lander
'Supergiant' found in deepest sea
A new record has been set for the world's deepest fish.
The bizarre-looking creature, which is new to science, was filmed 8,145m beneath the waves, beating the previous depth record by nearly 500m.
Several other new species of fish were also caught on camera, as well as huge crustaceans called supergiants.
The animals were discovered during an international expedition to the Mariana Trench, which lies almost 11km down in the Pacific Ocean.
The 30-day voyage took place from the Schmidt Ocean Institute's research vessel, Falkor, and is the most comprehensive survey of world's deepest place ever undertaken.
The Hadal Ecosystem Studies (Hades) team deployed unmanned landers more than 90 times to depths that ranged between 5,000m and 10,600m. They studied both steep walls of the undersea canyon.
Dr Jeff Drazen, co-chief scientist from the University of Hawaii, US, said: ""Many studies have rushed to the bottom of the trench, but from an ecological view that is very limiting.
""It's like trying to understand a mountain ecosystem by only looking at its summit.""
Ocean trench: Take a dive 11,000m down
The University of Aberdeen's Hadal Lander - the UK's deepest diving vehicle - recorded more than 100 hours of deep-sea footage.
Until this expedition, the deepest fish had been found in the Japan Trench, also in the Pacific Ocean. A 17-strong shoal of pink, gelatinous snailfish (Pseudoliparis amblystomopsis) were recorded 7,700m down.
Dr Alan Jamieson, from Oceanlab at the University of Aberdeen, said: ""After we found these, we started seeing them in other deep trenches. Each trench has its own snailfish species.
""And we saw one in the Mariana Trench at more than 8,000m, and we think it's a new species.""
The team thought they had broken the deepest-fish record, but then another pale pink species came to feed at the lander, which is loaded with bait, even further down at 8,145m.
Dr Jamieson said: ""We think it is a snailfish, but it's so weird-looking; it's up in the air in terms of what it is.
""It is unbelievably fragile, and when it swims, it looks like it has wet tissue paper floating behind it.
""And it has a weird snout - it looks like a cartoon dog snout.""
Without catching the fish and bringing it back to the surface, the team is unable to confirm that it is a new species, but Dr Jamieson said it did not look like anything he'd seen before or knew of.
The new record-breaking creature is close to the depth-limit at which scientists believe fish can survive.
Decapod shrimp are among the other residents of the deep ocean
They researchers also captured another bizarre species - supergiants - on camera.
These creatures are a type of amphipod, which are normally around 2-3cm long. The super-sized version can reach up to 30cm.
Dr Jamieson said: ""We've got more than 20 hours of footage of them, and we're learning the way they swim, the way they feed and the way they fend off predators.
""They clamp down on the bait, and bore their head into it and put their spiky tail in the air like a thorn bush.
""Anything that goes for it gets stabbed in the nose.""
The dives made during the expedition were all conducted by unmanned vehicles, but humans have visited the world's deepest place.
In 1960, US Navy Lt Don Walsh and Swiss oceanographer Jacques Piccard made an incredibly risky journey to the bottom of the Mariana Trench in a bathyscaphe called the Trieste.
And in 2012, Hollywood director James Cameron made a solo descent to the seafloor in his sub called the Deepsea Challenger.
He described the place as a desolate, alien world.

18 December 2014
From the section Front Page
A Canadian man has found a woman with the same name as his ex-girlfriend to travel with after booking a three-week holiday before they split up.
Jordan Axani, 28, broke up with Elizabeth Gallagher in May but couldn't get a refund for the trip.
After putting out a request on Reddit for a travelling companion with the same name and a Canadian passport, he received thousands of responses.
One was from student Elizabeth Quinn Gallagher from Nova Scotia.
Jordan picked the 23-year-old, a homeless shelter volunteer who has a boyfriend, after talking with her on the phone.
He said he was impressed with her social conscience.
A friend of Elizabeth Gallagher's tweeted a photo of her passport to Jordan Axani in November
""It's totally platonic,"" Jordan Axani said from New York, where the trip starts on Sunday.
""Do I think we'll become friends? Sure.""
The pair will also be visiting Milan, Prague, Paris, Bangkok and New Delhi until 8 January.
Other responses to his Reddit post were more odd.
Jordan, who's from Toronto, said he heard from hundreds of people, male and female, who offered to legally change their names.
""I thought it was worth a shot,"" he said. ""Why not throw something like this out there into the universe? And sure it's a little weird.
""I'll be the first person to say that but on the back side we had an incredible response which I never would have anticipated of people that haven't had the chance to go on trips like this.
""My original post remains true to this day. All I wanted was someone to take the ticket and just go and enjoy themselves.
""Whether we travel together, or spend any time together, is totally irrelevant to me.""
Jordan has now set up a charity called A Ticket Forward, which aims to fund trips for underprivileged people.
He said the original Elizabeth Gallagher had been in touch but didn't want to say she had said to him.

Nebraska and Oklahoma sue Colorado over legal marijuana
In 2012, Washington and Colorado became the first two US states to legalise the sale of recreational marijuana
Nebraska and Oklahoma have asked the US Supreme Court to nullify a 2012 law that made marijuana legal in the US state of Colorado.
The two states allege that Colorado's law is in violation of federal law.
They say that they are suing just Colorado, and not Washington state where marijuana is also legal, because they do not share a border with Washington.
Colorado's attorney general said their suit was without merit.
""Federal law undisputedly prohibits the production and sale of marijuana,"" said Nebraska attorney general Jon Bruning in a press release.
""Colorado has undermined the United States Constitution, and I hope the US Supreme Court will uphold our constitutional principles.""
Colorado's attorney general John Suthers said in a statement that the state had been expecting legal action after Nebraska and Oklahoma complained about marijuana grown in Colorado coming into their states.
But he said he would vigorously defend Colorado's law as ""it appears the plaintiffs' primary grievance stems from non-enforcement of federal laws regarding marijuana, as opposed to choices made by the voters of Colorado"".
Colorado's citizens voted to legalise marijuana in 2012, and earlier this year the state became the first in the US to offer marijuana for sale for recreational use.
Already, Colorado has collected $7m in taxes from marijuana sales, adding a valuable revenue stream to the state's coffers.
Washington state passed a similar measure in 2012, but marijuana only went on sale for recreational use there this past summer.
Alaska, Oregon, and the District of Columbia recently voted to legalise marijuana in November.
Industry trade groups criticised the legal action.
""Colorado has created a comprehensive and robust regulatory programme for the sale of marijuana in Colorado,"" said Mike Elliott, the director of the Marijuana Industry Group.
""If Nebraska and Oklahoma succeed, they will put the violent criminal organisations back in charge.""

The two girls faced back-to-back competency hearings on Thursday
Both girls accused of stabbing a Wisconsin classmate in order to please an online fictional character are competent to stand trial, a judge says.
Judge Michael Bohren ruled Morgan Geyser, 12 and Anissa Weier, 13, mentally competent during a hearing.
Doctors retained by the defence previously deemed Ms Geyser not mentally competent.
They allegedly stabbed another girl 19 times in ""dedication"" to Slenderman, a fictional website character.
The victim, also 12 at the time, was reportedly found by a cyclist on 31 May after crawling from the woods where she was attacked with stab wounds to her arms, legs and torso.
His decision means both cases will continue to preliminary hearings, where a judge will decide whether there is enough evidence for trial.
The unidentified victim thanked her well-wishers following the attack
She has recovered and since returned to school.
Both suspects were later found walking near a local highway, and a knife was found in one of the girls' backpacks, police said.
According to police, the girls planned to stab the classmate during a sleepover but instead decided to commit the crime the next morning in a nearby park.
Following their arrest they told investigators about their belief in paranormal figure Slenderman and their desire to become his ""proxies"" by killing to demonstrate their loyalty, police said.
After the murder, they reportedly intended to walk to Slenderman's mansion, which they believed was situated in Wisconsin's Nicolet National Forest.

Hundreds of federal police officers and members of the army have been deployed to La Ruana
More than 400 federal police officers and soldiers have been sent to a town in Mexico's western Michoacan state.
The deployment follows a shoot-out between two vigilante groups on Tuesday in which 11 people were killed.
Ballistic tests showed all of those killed had fired their weapons in the two-hour gun battle in La Ruana.
The two groups of vigilantes were set up to fight the local drug cartel, but have since become bitter rivals and have started fighting each other.
Gunfight
Five members of a group led by Hipolito Mora and six followers of his rival, Luis Antonio Torres, were killed.
Luis Antonio Torres (centre) says his men were fired on by gunmen shooting from rooftops
Hipolito Mora (foreground) says he will not give up his weapons
Mr Mora's 33-year-old son was also among those shot dead.
Mr Torres told local media that his men had been fired on as they were approaching a roadblock manned by members of Mr Mora's vigilante group.
""We only felt the bullets raining down on us, so we defended ourselves,"" he said, describing how Mr Mora's supporters shot at them from surrounding rooftops.
""We weren't going to stand by with our arms crossed waiting to be killed.""
Mr Mora did not give a description of the shooting but said he would request protection from the police.
Mr Mora said he would not give up his weapons or ask his men to disarm because ""that would be akin to suicide"".
Growing tension
Security commissioner Alfredo Castillo said that if evidence suggested Mr Mora was involved in the shooting, he would be detained.
Federal investigators searched the scene of Tuesday's shootout for evidence
Mr Mora's and Mr Torres's ""self-defence groups"" were set up in February 2013 to fight a drugs cartel calling itself the Knights Templar.
Earlier this year, they took control of a number of towns in the western state and drove out the Knights Templar, who had been extorting money from local businessmen and farmers.
But tensions soon emerged between the different groups, which accused each other of having been infiltrated by the very same drugs gang they were set up to fight.
There were also disputes as the groups seized ranches and land previously held by the Knights Templar.

Colombia general set to be freed
Colombia's Farc rebels have declared a unilateral ceasefire for an indefinite period, starting from Saturday.
The leftist rebels said the truce should become a formal armistice and would only end if they were attacked.
The announcement was made in Cuba, where the Farc has been holding peace talks with the Colombian government.
President Juan Manuel Santos has so far refused to suspend military action, saying the rebels would use a bilateral truce to rearm and regroup.
The peace talks in Cuba - which began in 2012 - are aimed at ending five decades of conflict that has killed an estimated 220,000 people.
'Renewed pressure'
""We have resolved to declare a unilateral ceasefire and end hostilities for an indefinite period of time, which should be transformed into an armistice,"" the Farc said in a statement.
Colombia's largest rebel group had previously called for a bilateral truce - but these moves have been rejected by the government in Bogota.
The peace talks were almost derailed in September after the Farc captured Gen Ruben Dario Alzate, prompting President Santos to suspend the negotiations.
The rebels released the general unharmed in November in an effort to revive the talks.
But following Wednesday's announcement by the Farc, President Santos may come under renewed pressure now to match the rebel offer, BBC regional analyst Leonardo Rocha says.

Tackling the militants of Mombasa
Kenyan lawmakers traded blows and the deputy speaker had water thrown on her during a chaotic parliamentary session which approved changes to a tough new security bill.
Opposition MPs shouted and ripped up copies of the bill, warning that Kenya was becoming a ""police state"".
Four lawmakers were assaulted and another two engaged in a fist-fight.
Parliamentary officials adjourned the debate twice, before the controversial changes were pushed through.
The government says it needs more powers to fight militant Islamists threatening Kenya's security.
The al-Qaeda-linked al-Shabab group has stepped up its military campaign in Kenya, killing 64 people in two attacks in the north-eastern Mandera region since last month.

Security staff and MPs surrounded Speaker Justin Muturi as voting got under way, our correspondent says.
Earlier, opposition MPs mobbed his rostrum and threw books, documents and other projectiles in a bid to block the vote, AFP news agency reports.
But the two sides set aside their differences to endorse President Uhuru Kenyatta's nomination of former army general Joseph Nkaissery as interior minister.
His predecessor was sacked after the Mandera attacks.
At one point, live television broadcasts of the debate were cut as the session degenerated into chaos, our correspondent says.
'Draconian'
A group of pro-government MPs accosted opposition senators who were in the public gallery and tried to eject them, he says.
In the ensuing commotion, one of the senators had his shirt torn, while outside the parliamentary chamber an opposition and pro-government MP threw punches at each other, our correspondent adds.
Al-Shabab has increasingly targeted Kenya
Opposition MPs threw water on Deputy Speaker Joyce Laboso, who ordered two of them to be thrown out.
MPs chanted ""no way"" and ""the struggle continues"" as they tore up copies of the bill.
Correspondents say there was a heavy police presence around parliament after activists called for protests to show their opposition to the bill.
MPs were recalled from their Christmas break to approve changes to the bill passed last week.
The bill was denounced by the opposition as draconian. They fear that the proposed amendments will make it even worse.
It gives the security and intelligence agencies the right to detain terror suspects for up to one year, to tap communications without court consent and requires  journalists to obtain police permission before investigating or publishing stories on domestic terrorism and security issues.
President Uhuru Kenyatta has defended the bill, saying it is important for the country's security needs.

A pile of counterfeit currency was found during a search of the suspect's home in Uganda
US authorities have arrested an American in Uganda for allegedly leading a large international counterfeiting ring.
Ryan Gustafson, 27, was charged with conspiracy and counterfeiting outside the US after the fake currency was used at multiple American businesses.
The US Secret Service traced the money to Kampala, where they say they found a counterfeit ring also producing euros, rupees and various African currencies.
The suspect faces 25 years in prison.
""We will hold cyber criminals accountable and bring them to justice no matter where they reside,"" US Attorney for the Western District of Pennsylvania David Hickton wrote in a statement.
Fake US currency was discovered at Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, retail stores and businesses and traced to a postal box in the area.
Federal agents determined the currency was being sent from Uganda. A fingerprint on one of the packages led them to Mr Gustafson, a US citizen who previously resided in Texas.
The search in Uganda uncovered a pair of Anon Hands, used as gloves to obscure the wearer's fingerprints
Mr Gustafson is said to have located couriers through an online forum and established contact with them through private message.
The Secret Service coordinated with Ugandan authorities to set up an undercover sting operation to purchase counterfeit currency from the suspect.
He was arrested, and a subsequent search of his home netted a cache of fake Ugandan shillings, Congolese francs, Ghanaian cedis, Indian rupees and euros, as well as various counterfeiting materials.
US authorities estimate the suspect flooded the market with nearly $2m (£1.28m) in counterfeit currencies.
Mr Gustafson has been charged with conspiracy, selling and dealing in counterfeit currency, and unlawful possession of ammunition.
He faces a lengthy prison sentence and a fine of $500,000.

By Richard Bilton BBC Panorama
Richard Bilton reports from Shanghai: ''An exhausted workforce''
Poor treatment of workers in Chinese factories which make Apple products has been discovered by an undercover BBC Panorama investigation.
Filming on an iPhone 6 production line showed Apple's promises to protect workers were routinely broken.
It found standards on workers' hours, ID cards, dormitories, work meetings and juvenile workers were being breached at the Pegatron factories.
Apple said it strongly disagreed with the programme's conclusions.
Exhausted workers were filmed falling asleep on their 12-hour shifts at the Pegatron factories on the outskirts of Shanghai.
One undercover reporter, working in a factory making parts for Apple computers, had to work 18 days in a row despite repeated requests for a day off.
Another reporter, whose longest shift was 16 hours, said: ""Every time I got back to the dormitories, I wouldn't want to move.
""Even if I was hungry I wouldn't want to get up to eat.  I just wanted to lie down and rest. I was unable to sleep at night because of the stress.""
'Continuous improvement'
Apple declined to be interviewed for the programme, but said in a statement: ""We are aware of no other company doing as much as Apple to ensure fair and safe working conditions.
""We work with suppliers to address shortfalls, and we see continuous and significant improvement, but we know our work is never done.""
Apple said it was a very common practice for workers to nap during breaks, but it would investigate any evidence they were falling asleep while working.
It said it monitored the working hours of more than a million workers and that staff at Pegatron were averaging 55 hours a week.

The poor conditions in Chinese factories were highlighted in 2010 when 14 workers killed themselves at Apple's biggest supplier, Foxconn.
Following the suicides, Apple published a set of standards spelling out how factory workers should be treated. It also moved some of its production work to Pegatron's factories on the outskirts of Shanghai.
But Panorama's undercover reporters found that these standards were routinely breached on the factory floor.
Overtime is supposed to be voluntary, but none of the reporters were offered any choice. In addition to the excessive hours, one reporter had to attend unpaid meetings before and after work.  Another reporter was housed in a dormitory where 12 workers shared a cramped room.
Apple says the dormitory overcrowding has now been resolved and that it requires suppliers to retroactively pay workers if it finds they haven't been paid for work meetings.
Pegatron said it was carefully investigating Panorama's claims and would take all necessary action if any deficiencies were found at their facilities.
""Worker safety and well-being are our top priorities. We set very high standards, conduct rigorous training for managers and workers, and have external auditors regularly visiting our facilities to find areas for improvement,"" a statement said.
Dangerous conditions
Panorama also travelled further down Apple's supply chain to the Indonesian island of Bangka.
Apple says it is dedicated to the ethical sourcing of minerals, but the programme found evidence that tin from illegal mines could be entering its supply chain.
It found children digging tin ore out by hand in extremely dangerous conditions - miners can be buried alive when the walls of sand or mud collapse.
Rainto, 12, said he was worried about landslides
Twelve-year-old Rianto was working with his dad at the bottom of a 70-foot cliff of sand. He said: ""I worry about landslides. The earth slipping from up there to the bottom. It could happen.""
Panorama tracked down a gang who collect tin from the area where Rianto was working. One of them said they sold tin to a smelter on Apple's list of suppliers.
Johan Murod, who runs one of the smelters on Apple's list, said 70% of the tin that is exported comes from the small-scale mines.
""At the smelter there's everything from both large and small scale mines. It's all mixed.  There's no way to know what is legal and what is illegal.""
Apple says it is a complex situation on Bangka with tens of thousands of miners selling tin through many middle men.
""The simplest course of action would be for Apple to unilaterally refuse any tin from Indonesian mines. That would be easy for us to do and would certainly shield us from criticism.
""But that would also be the lazy and cowardly path, since it would do nothing to improve the situation. We have chosen to stay engaged and attempt to drive changes on the ground.""

While falling oil prices have recently caught the attention of many, the cost of gas has also been coming down. That's because demand in Europe has been falling due to a relatively warm winter so far. Richard Green professor of sustainable energy business at Imperial College London tells Today we shouldn't expect lower energy bills are a result. That's because energy suppliers are selling us gas they bought at last year's prices.

The original tree tower was visible well inside North Korea
North Korea threatens nuclear test
A South Korean Christian group has cancelled plans to erect a Christmas-tree shaped tower close to the border with the North.
The Christian Council of Korea (CCK) said their aim was peaceful, but had led to fears of ""inter-Korean tension"".
The CCK had a 60ft (18m) tree tower near the border for several years, but it was dismantled in October by the army, which said it was unstable.
The North, which is officially atheist, views the tower as propaganda warfare.
It had in the past threatened to shell it.
South Korean 'Christmas Tree'
Original 60ft (18m) tower was built in 1971 by Christian Council of Korea
Located about 3km (1.9 miles) from the border on top of a hill in Gimpo, west of Seoul
When lit up, the tower and the cross on top could be seen from the North Korean city of Kaesong.
Demolished in October 2014 over safety concerns but permission was given for a new, smaller tower.
CCK says the tree promotes peace and religious freedom.
North Korea says it is psychological warfare, while many South Koreans view it as antagonistic
CCK had said the new smaller ""tree"" would be 30ft (9m) tall and lit for two weeks starting 23 December to promote peace.
But North Korea said the group would be held responsible for the ""catastrophic impact"" if it went ahead with the plans.
On Thursday, CCK official Hong Jae-chul said their ""pure intention caused undesirable misunderstanding that it would aggravate inter-Korean friction"" and had caused ""jitters among local citizens"".
Tensions at the heavily militarised border are particularly high at the moment, with several small exchanges of fire in October.
Relationships between the two Koreas, which are technically at war, remain deadlocked with talks on ending the North's nuclear programme long stalled.
The North has also been angered in recent months by a United Nations resolution condemning the human rights situation in the communist country.

Dutch far-right politician Geert Wilders is due to be prosecuted over allegations he incited racial hatred against Moroccans, the authorities say.
The charges stem from an incident in which Mr Wilders led an anti-Moroccan chant during a speech in March.
The Dutch public prosecutor later received more than 6,400 complaints.
Mr Wilders, who leads the Party for Freedom (PVV), has often expressed his distaste for Islam and mass immigration.
In response to the prosecution, Mr Wilders described the charges in a statement as ""a travesty"".
""The public prosecutor would do better to devote his time to prosecuting jihadis instead of me,"" he said.
Mr Wilders made his comments during a political meeting in The Hague.
Asking supporters in a cafe if they wanted fewer Moroccans in the country, some responded by chanting ""Fewer! Fewer! Fewer!""
The politician then replied: ""I will fix it for you.""
During a later television interview he referred to ""Moroccan scum"", the Reuters news agency reports.

Levels of obesity are rising across Europe
Where are you on the global fat scale?
Obesity can constitute a disability in certain circumstances, the EU's highest court has ruled.
The European Court of Justice was asked to consider the case of a male childminder in Denmark who says he was sacked for being too fat.
The court said that if obesity could hinder ""full and effective participation"" at work then it could count as a disability.
The ruling is binding across the EU.

“Start Quote
If employers suddenly have to start ensuring that they've got wider seats, larger tables, more parking spaces for people who are obese, I think then we're just making the situation worse”
End Quote Jane Deville Almond British Obesity Society
Judges said that obesity in itself was not a disability - but if a person had a long-term impairment because of their obesity, then they would be protected by disability legislation.
The case centres around childminder Karsten Kaltoft who weighs about 160kg (25 stone).
He brought a discrimination case against his employers of 15 years, Billund local authority, after he was sacked four years ago.
The authority said a fall in the number of children meant Mr Kaltoft was no longer required.
But Mr Kaltoft said he was dismissed because he was overweight.
'No problems'
Earlier this year, he told the BBC that reports that he was so fat he was unable to bend down to tie children's shoelaces were untrue.
Describing his work with children, he said: ""I can sit on the floor and play with them, I have no problems like that.
""I don't see myself as disabled. It's not OK just to fire a person because they're fat, if they're doing their job properly.""
The Danish courts asked the European Court of Justice (ECJ) to clarify whether obesity was a disability.
The ECJ ruled that if the obesity of the worker ""hinders the full and effective participation of that person in professional life on an equal basis with other workers"", then obesity can fall within the concept of ""disability"".
Rulings from the European Court of Justice are binding for all EU member nations.
The courts in Denmark will now have to assess Mr Kaltoft's weight to see if his case can be classed as a disability.
Analysis by Clive Coleman, BBC's legal correspondent
Today's ruling was of great interest to employers across Europe. The judgement makes no direct link between Body Mass Index and obesity, but is a powerful statement that an obese worker whose weight hinders their performance at work is entitled to disability protection.
That will mean employers must, on a case by case basis, make reasonable adjustments such as providing larger chairs or special car parking, and protect such employees from verbal harassment.
But there are wider implications. Providers of goods and services such as shops, cinemas and restaurants will also have to make reasonable adjustments for their customers, which might include things like special seating arrangements.
The key concept here is that adjustments must be ""reasonable"" - so it may be deemed reasonable for a Premier League football club to make two seats available for someone disabled through obesity, but not for a small, non-league club.
Obesity, particularly what is sometimes known as morbid or severe and complex obesity, can be a particularly sensitive subject.
Employers and service providers will have to take care not to make assumptions about the needs of an obese worker or customer.
'Wider seats'
Jane Deville Almond, the chairwoman of the British Obesity Society, said obesity should not be classed as a disability.
She told the BBC: ""I think the downside would be that if employers suddenly have to start ensuring that they've got wider seats, larger tables, more parking spaces for people who are obese, I think then we're just making the situation worse.
Employers could be required to make their offices more accessible for obese employees
""[It is] implying that people have no control over the condition, rather than something that can be greatly improved by changing behaviour.""
Paul Callaghan, head of employment law at international law firm Taylor Wessing, said the ruling does not change UK law.
""The European Court of Justice has ruled that obesity itself is not a disability, but that the effects of it can be.
""As such, workers who suffer from, for example, joint problems, depression, or diabetes - specifically because of their size - will be protected by the European Equal Treatment Framework Directive and cannot be dismissed because of their weight.""
Employers' responsibility
Audrey Williams, employment law partner at Eversheds, said the mere fact someone is obese is not enough to make them disabled.
""What the court are saying is that obesity is not protected unless it hinders professional life.""
She said the ruling would increase awareness among employers of their responsibility towards obese employees in the workplace.
This could include making reasonable adjustments to working arrangements, seating arrangements or making access to the office easier.
However, Tam Fry, from the National Obesity Forum, said the ruling had opened a can of worms for UK employers.
""They will be required to make adjustments to their furniture and doors and whatever is needed for very large people.
""I believe it will also cause friction in the workplace between obese people and other workers.""
One in four people in the UK is classified as obese.

Albert Ebosse: New tests claim Cameroonian died after beating
New post-mortem tests indicate Cameroonian footballer Albert Ebosse died as a result of a beating rather than being hit by a projectile.
The JS Kabylie striker died in August after his side lost a league match.
Findings by the Algerian authorities stated that the 24-year-old was killed by a sharp projectile thrown by fans.
But pathologist Andre Moune told BBC World TV: ""When you see the injuries to his shoulders, the only way that can be explained is by a physical attack.""
The Cameroonian carried out the tests at the request of Ebosse's family.
He reported the player received ""a blow to the head"" that caused ""an indentation of the skull"" that impacted his brain and that he had suffered upper body injuries indicating ""signs of struggle"".
Other signs of violence included ""rupture of cervical vertebrae"" and a wound to the shoulder.
His findings have been sent to Algerian and Cameroonian authorities for further action.
Moune added: ""Shortly after his death, we saw a video of Ebosse, after the match, surrounded by police and leaving the pitch to enter the dressing room.
""We didn't see anything happen to him on the pitch or anything that prevented him leaving the pitch because of a missile.
""It can't be a slate tile, as the Algerians stated in their report, because if someone threw a tile, even at high speed, it couldn't cause such severe wounds like the ones I found on the body.
""For such an object to break through into the skull, it needs a heavy strength. The object that hit him came from close range.""
The official Algerian version suggested Ebosse died in hospital on 23 August from head injuries sustained as he left the pitch under a hail of objects thrown from the stands.
Albert Ebosse's body was returned to Cameroon after his death
At the time, Algerian Sports Minister Mohamed Tahmi said Ebosse died after being struck by a piece of sharp slate.
Tahmi has refused to comment on the new test results.
Ebosse's family said they had urged Cameroonian authorities and the Confederation of African Football to take action following the new evidence.
They also claimed neither JS Kabylie, where Ebosse was the top scorer last season, nor the Algerian league had made good on promises after his death to provide financial compensation to the family for their loss.
The incident led to JS Kabylie being banned from pan-African competitions for two years and forced to play home league matches in empty stadiums.

Abdul Fattah al-Sisi: New face of Egypt's old guard
Dozens of Egyptian Islamists accused of torching churches and police stations after the ousting of former President Mohammed Morsi have been jailed for up to 15 years.
Prosecutors said the 40 men were involved in attacks which swept through the southern city of Assiut last year.
The court acquitted 61 others involved in the case.
The Egyptian authorities have jailed more than 16,000 people since last August.
At least 1,400 people have also been killed in a wide-ranging crackdown against opponents of the government.
Following the ousting of Mr Morsi in the summer of 2013 there was unrest across the country.
In Assiut, several police stations were set alight along with five churches and a number of shops.
Delivering its verdict the city's criminal court sentenced two defendants to 15 years in prison, AFP news agency reported, while others were handed jail terms ranging from one year to 10.
Dozens of Mr Morsi's supporters have been sentenced to death in mass trials over the past year.
Mr Morsi and fellow leaders of the now banned Muslim Brotherhood organisation are also being held in jail or on trial facing the death penalty.

'Times have changed' on women troops
Women could be allowed to serve in British infantry units for the first time by 2016, the BBC understands.
An Army review of the ban on women serving in close combat is continuing, having been commissioned by ex-Defence Secretary Philip Hammond.
But military sources have told the BBC there is now a ""real desire"" among ministers to end the restrictions.
However, concerns remain about whether women can cope with the physical demands of an infantry soldier.
There are also concerns that if they become injured, this could lead to claims for compensation.
'Killer instinct'
Currently women can serve on the front line, but not where the primary aim is to ""close with and kill the enemy"".
This means women are not permitted to serve in the infantry or armoured corps where they could be involved in close combat.
Female aircrew have been flying combat missions over Iraq, and this year the Royal Navy allowed women to serve on submarines for the first time.
Women soldiers have also been on the frontline in Afghanistan although in support roles, such as medics and bomb disposal experts.
BBC defence correspondent Jonathan Beale said the review on women serving in the infantry, commissioned last May, has put to rest some of the old arguments that barred them, such as that women lack the killer instinct and could undermine a unit's cohesion, affecting its ability to fight.
A defence source told the BBC the wellbeing of British personnel is of the utmost importance, but there is now genuine hope that all areas of the armed forces will be opened up to women, following further research conducted as part of the Army review.
The Ministry of Defence says it needs to carry out more research but military sources say that if those concerns are addressed, women could eventually serve in units like the infantry.

"28","Record 500,000 started university","Record numbers of students entered university this year, but the gender gap has never been wider, according to annual admission figures.","University entrants: Record 500,000 started courses in 2014
By Sean Coughlan Education correspondent
The gender gap in university entry is wider than ever before
The number of UK university entrants passed 500,000 for the first time in 2014, with women still more likely to enter higher education than men, Ucas admissions service figures show.
Among 18-year-olds, 34% of women were allocated university places, compared with 26% of men.
The gap is more than 50% in a quarter of parliamentary constituencies.
The admissions figures also suggest more students with lower grades are getting places at top universities.
About a third of applicants getting BBB grades got places in ""higher tariff"" universities, about twice as many as in 2011.
There was also an increase in universities making unconditional offers to applicants they most want to recruit.
Wide variations
This year's university admissions figures show a rising tide of more applications, more offers and more accepted places.
Some 512,400 people secured places in UK universities and colleges through Ucas applications in 2014, up nearly 17,000.  The number of UK students rose 3% to 447,500, and there was a record number of students from outside the UK.
But there were wide variations among the UK entrants.
The gap between entry rates for rich and poor students has narrowed
The Ucas figures suggest women are much more likely to enter university than men. This applies to both rich and poor families and across almost all regions.
According to Ucas, two decades ago there was no gender gap, but this has now become one of the most distinctive features of applications.
Among 18-year-olds, the numbers of women going to university is continuing to rise more quickly than their male counterparts.
In some constituencies the male entry rates are even lower. In Bristol South only 11% of 18-year-old men go on to university.
In contrast there are constituencies where more than half of female school leavers go straight to university.
Ucas says the gender gap in entry rates is the equivalent of 32,000 ""missing"" male students.
Regional differences
While the gap between male and female is at its widest ever, the gap between rich and poor is at its lowest.
Record numbers of disadvantaged students are getting places in higher education, rising by 11% compared with last year.
These students were particularly likely to enter with BTEC qualifications, rather than A-levels.
For young applicants in England, 85% were accepted for a university place this year
But regional differences remain across the UK. Young people in London and Northern Ireland are the most likely to enter university - those in Wales and the South West of England have the lowest entry rates.
There are even lower figures for Scotland, but these are incomplete because Ucas does not cover admissions for all Scottish higher education.
There are even wider local differences - with some places having average entry rates below 15% while others are above 50%.
Buyers' market
The admissions figures also show the growing competition between universities to attract students.
Universities are making more offers than ever before, 1.8 million this year, with students with high predicted grades getting four or five offers.
Students without A or A* grades at A-level were more likely this year to have got into a selective ""higher tariff"" university. For students with three B grades, 35% got places into a top-tier university, compared with 32% last year and 17% in 2011.
Among students with BBC grades, 15% got places at higher tariff universities, compared with 6% in 2011.
For applicants with DDE grades, 12% got into ""medium tariff"" universities and 58% found a place at a ""lower tariff"" university.
Across all types of university, the Ucas figures show that 85% of 18-year-old applicants from England were accepted for a place somewhere.
Mary Curnock Cook, Ucas chief executive, said the increase in university entrance by disadvantaged students was a ""stunning account of social change"".
""These trends are pushing the difference in entry rates between rich and poor to historic lows,"" she said.
Nicola Dandridge, chief executive of Universities UK, said the rising number of applications represented the end of the volatility that followed the increase in tuition fees.
""It suggests a return to stability in university applications following the changes and dip in 2012,"" she said.
Universities Minister Greg Clark said: ""For the first time ever over half a million students have entered higher education, with entry rates for students from disadvantaged backgrounds increasing by over 10% to its highest ever levels across the UK.
""Higher education is a transformational experience and that is why we are the first government to remove the limit on student numbers lifting the cap on aspiration.""

Bumble Bee, the largest canned tuna and sardine producer in North America, is currently owned by private equity firm Lion Capital.
The purchase is aimed at expanding Thai Union's presence overseas and is expected to increase revenues by 25%.
Thai Union said the deal was the biggest acquisition in its history.
Its chief executive, Thiraphong Chansiri, called the deal ""one of the most exciting external growth propositions"".
""Bumble Bee Seafoods is a leading player in North American shelf-stable seafood; combining the business with Thai Union Group will lower costs, improve efficiency, and create the global leader in the shelf-stable seafood space,"" he said in a statement.
The Thai firm, which owns the John West and Chicken of the Sea brands, has been on an acquisition spree in the past year.
Earlier this year, it announced that was buying Norwegian seafood firm King Oscar and French smoked salmon producer MerAlliance for undisclosed sums.

China has conducted three nationwide economic censuses to review the size of their economy
China trade data below expectations
China has revised up the size of its economy in 2013 by 3.4%, which works out to be about the size of Malaysia's economic output.
A nationwide economic census, conducted every five years, revealed that its gross domestic product (GDP) was 58.8 trillion yuan ($9.5tn; £6tn) last year.
The revised data was compiled by surveying 70 million businesses across the country over three months.
The new figures are not expected to affect China's 2014 growth rate.
The Chinese government had set a target of 7.5% growth this year but it is widely expected to miss that. The figures are due out next month.
The world's second-largest economy has been experiencing a slowdown in its manufacturing sector, cooling exports and problems in its property sector.
Julian Evans-Pritchard, China economist at Capital Economics said the GDP revision provides ""some positive news on rebalancing"".
""The relatively small upwards adjustment, compared with previous censuses revisions, won't make a huge difference to how the economy is viewed or to key metrics, such as China's debt to GDP ratio,"" he wrote in a research note.
""The breakdown of the revision shows that the lion's share of the increase came from the service sector. Its share of GDP increased from 46.1% to 46.9% as a result of the revision. The contribution from industry fell from 43.9% to 43.7%.""
He adds that China's change in methodology could also lead to further increases in reported GDP by between 3% to 5%.
""Today's revision is not the end of the story,"" he said. ""The NBS [National Bureau of Statistics] has also been adjusting the national accounts data to bring them into line with international best practice. These changes now seem likely to be introduced early next year.""
China's last two censuses took place in 2004, where GDP was boosted by 16.8%, and 2008, where it gained 4.4%.

06:48: Gas prices BBC Radio 4
Professor Green says energy suppliers have an eye on politics at the moment. He says Labour leader Ed Miliband's promise to freeze energy prices for 20 months if his party wins next year's election may mean suppliers will keep prices artificially high despite currently benefitting from lower gas costs.
 
 
06:34: Gas prices BBC Radio 4
While falling oil prices have recently caught the attention of many, the cost of gas has also been coming down. That's because demand in Europe has been falling due to a relatively warm winter so far. Richard Green professor of sustainable energy business at Imperial College London tells Today we shouldn't expect lower energy bills are a result. That's because energy suppliers are selling us gas they bought at last year's prices.

"32","Balotelli gets one-match ban & fine","Liverpool striker Mario Balotelli gets a one-match ban and £25,000 fine from the FA as punishment for his Super Mario post.","Mario Balotelli: Liverpool striker banned for one game and fined
This story contains language which you may find offensive.
Liverpool striker Mario Balotelli has been given a one-match ban by the Football Association as punishment for his Super Mario post on social media.
The Italian, whose suspension rules him out of Sunday's home game against Arsenal, has also been fined £25,000 and must attend an education course.
The 24-year-old was charged under FA rule E3(1) for a post which appeared to contain anti-Semitic and racist references.
Balotelli had accepted the charge but wrote to the FA in mitigation.
After learning of his punishment, he wrote on his official Facebook page  that the FA's decision ""made clear"" that his post had been ""wrong"".
Balotelli forwarded on a picture produced by someone else
He added: ""I am sorry that my team-mates and supporters of Liverpool FC have to be penalised for something I did and now come to regret. It is my intention to comply with the decision of the FA and make sure it never happens again.""
A Liverpool spokesman said: ""The club acknowledges the decision reached by the FA independent panel and due consideration will be given to the written judgement once we receive it from the FA.
""Any further action taken by ourselves in relation to this matter is between the club and player.""
Former Manchester City forward Balotelli reposted an image of computer game character Super Mario on Instagram which included the words ""jumps like a black man and grabs coins like a Jew.""
He later tweeted to deny the post was offensive, before apologising.
Balotelli returned to the Liverpool squad for Sunday's defeat by Manchester United at Old Trafford after six games out with a groin problem.
But he was not involved in Wednesday's League Cup win at Bournemouth.
He has scored two goals in his 15 appearances for the club since signing from AC Milan in the summer.

Fifa World Cup corruption report: Michael Garcia quitting 'a new low'
Michael Garcia's decision to resign as Fifa's independent ethics investigator is a new low for football's governing body, says vice-president Jim Boyce.
American lawyer Garcia claimed Fifa published an ""incomplete and erroneous"" report following his two-year study into 2018 and 2022 World Cup bidding.
When asked if it was a new low for Fifa, Boyce replied: ""I don't think there's any doubt about that.""
On Friday, Fifa members will vote on whether to publish a longer report.
In December 2010, it was announced that Russia would host the 2018 World Cup, with Qatar staging international football's biggest competition four years later.
Garcia was asked to file a report into allegations of corruption in the bidding process, however his findings were condensed from an original 430-page report into a 42-page summary.
""I have always said that as much of this report as is legally possible should be put in the public domain and until that is done it's not going to go away,"" added Boyce, Britain's most senior football official.
Northern Ireland's Jim Boyce was president of the Irish Football Association for 12 years
""I will vote that as much as can be legally published should be published. If people have nothing to hide why are they afraid of something being issued?""
The vote will be held at a meeting in Marrakesh, Morocco, but it is unclear how many members will be allowed to take part.
The Fifa committee consisted of 22 members in December 2010 and president Sepp Blatter has previously said only those people should be able to vote on whether to issue a more comprehensive corruption report.
However, of those original 22, only 13 are still on the committee. It means that 12 members of Fifa's committee (which now consists of 25 people), as well as a further two co-opted members, would not be eligible to vote.

"34","Vettel affected by Ricciardo pace","Sebastian Vettel left Red Bull partly because of the pace of team-mate Daniel Ricciardo, says team boss Christian Horner.","Sebastian Vettel's departure influenced by Ricciardo's pace
By Andrew Benson Chief F1 writer
Programme Details
BBC Formula 1 Review - Lewis Hamilton: Duel of the Silver Arrows, Saturday 27 December, 13:00 GMT, BBC One
Sebastian Vettel's decision to leave Red Bull was influenced by the pace of his team-mate Daniel Ricciardo, team boss Christian Horner says.
The German, who won four titles with Red Bull from 2010-14, has joined Ferrari after a year in which Ricciardo won three races and Vettel none.
Horner says Ricciardo was ""probably a factor"" in Vettel's decision.
And he said the Australian's overtake of Vettel at the Italian GP was ""quite a defining moment for Sebastian"".
Ricciardo dummied Vettel into the second chicane at Monza, feigning to pass one way before going the other, to beat him to fifth place in the race.
Horner, speaking in an interview for the BBC F1 review show, said of Vettel: ""He was enormously frustrated after that grand prix.
The German will drive for Ferrari next season, following in the footsteps of hero Michael Schumacher
""It was at a time where after the summer break, knowing Sebastian as well as I do, I could see he was very distracted and it was obvious something was at the back of his mind.
""And I think Ferrari were courting him quite hard and around Spa/Monza was the time he made the decision to do something different next year.""
Horner said he was ""not really"" surprised Vettel decided to leave and move to Ferrari as a replacement for Fernando Alonso, who negotiated an early exit from his contract.
Horner said he believed Vettel had made a final decision on his future between the Italian and Singapore races in September.
""By the time he got to Singapore you could see he was a different person,"" Horner said.
""He was more relaxed and you could see he had made his mind up, but events had to unfold through Fernando actually leaving Ferrari. So, no, it wasn't a great surprise in the end.""

Vettel has insisted he is ""not running away from anything"" at Red Bull and that he simply wanted a change of scenery and the chance to drive for Ferrari, where his childhood hero and later friend Michael Schumacher won five world titles.
Vettel will be team-mate there to Kimi Raikkonen in 2015.
Horner said: ""The timing was right for Sebastian. He'd had a great run with us. He'd been with Red Bull since 12 years of age.
""He's won four world championships, 39 grands prix, 45 pole positions and I think he felt: 'I've reached 27 years of age. I don't want to end my career without having driven for Ferrari and I have a great opportunity to go there.'
""The lure of Ferrari for any driver is immensely powerful.""
Vettel feels 'ready for next step'
Vettel finished fifth in the championship, with Ricciardo third, having been out-scored by 71 points. Ricciardo out-qualified his team-mate 12 times in 19 races.
Horner said Vettel struggled to adapt to the new cars in F1 this year following the introduction of V6 turbo hybrid engines, reductions in downforce and a fuel restriction.
""He didn't like what F1 had become and was quite vocal about it - didn't like the engines, the noise, the way the car felt,"" Horner said.
""He was pretty upset about that at the beginning but once he realised that was it - it wasn't going to change - he started to get his head around it. He worked very hard, as he always has.
""But he got very frustrated the car wasn't doing what he wanted it to do and of course to compound that his team-mate is winning a couple of races and performing at the level he was.""
Red Bull team principal Christian Horner said the new rules in F1 had affected Vettel's driving style
Horner said the banning of exhaust-influenced rear aerodynamics, a technology in which Red Bull had excelled in the previous four seasons, had a big effect on Vettel.
""The rule changes were significant and the two guys who seem to have been affected most are Seb and Kimi and I think taking away the rear downforce has actually been a big factor for Sebastian,"" Horner said.
""How he generated his lap time was very much using the rear of the car on entry into the slower corners, which was much diminished this year, and that together with the brake-by-wire system had taken away some of the feeling of the braking that he is so dependent on.
""He is such a 'feel' driver that some of those feelings had been muted and it dumbed down some of his performance.""

Ennio Morricone has received 56 awards for his musical scores
Bjork wins Polar music accolade
Renowned Italian film composer Ennio Morricone said he regrets saying ""no"" to Clint Eastwood.
The 86-year-old wrote the score to the 1960s trilogy of spaghetti Westerns by Sergio Leone, which saw Eastwood rise to fame.
But Morricone said he turned down the chance to write for films Eastwood directed ""out of respect"" to Leone.
""I missed a great opportunity and I am really sorry,"" he told the BBC's arts editor Will Gompertz.
Morricone, or Maestro, as he is known in his hometown of Rome, added: ""When Clint called me, I said no out of respect to Sergio Leone, not because I did not like the movies that he did.""
Although he had first met Sergio Leone when they were at school, it was not until 25 years later that their professional partnership began, on a Fistful of Dollars in 1964.
""Gradually over time, he as a director and me as a composer, we improved and reached our best, in my opinion, in Once Upon A Time In America,"" the composer said.
Ennio Morricone was awarded an honorary Oscar in 2007 by Clint Eastwood
They went on to work together on Once Upon a Time in the West (1968) and Leone's last credited western, A Fistful of Dynamite (1971).
""After this relationship with Leone I was able to suggest to other directors how to respond to the music
""Often directors ask me for pieces lasting 20 seconds and in 20 seconds people do not understand - it is music that is wasted,"" he added.
Morricone, who will resume his European tour next year, said that being a composer is a ""difficult profession"" and he gets worried by every film he works on.
""There are ideas that crop up immediately but the majority arrive late.
""There is no film that has not worried me. I was worried for all of them, it is a difficult profession,"" the composer said.
Some of Morricone's most memorable scores include Roland Joffe's The Mission (1986), Giuseppe Tornatore's Cinema Paradiso (1988), and Quentin Tarantino's Kill Bill (2003) and Inglourious Basterds (2009).
Over the years, the Italian Maestro has received 56 awards, including five Baftas, but missed out on Oscars for Days of Heaven (1979) and The Mission (1986).
In 2007, he was awarded an honorary Oscar, presented by Clint Eastwood, for ""his magnificent and multifaceted contributions to the art of film music"".
Morricone wrote the musical scores for some of Leone's westerns such as Once Upon a Time in the West
The Italian composer said that winning awards is a ""celebration of the cinema"".
""They are great to advertise the cinema, they are important for those who receive them but most of all for the cinema, it is a celebration of the cinema.""
Despite working in an American-dominated industry, Morricone has never moved to Hollywood, remaining rooted in Rome, where he was born in 1928.
""I have been tempted. I was invited to live in Hollywood, I said no. I am better here,"" he said.
After a year of recovery from a spinal injury, Morricone's My Life in Music, World Tour will resume on 1 February 2015 in Amsterdam, stopping in 20 European cities.

Virna Lisi, pictured in 2010, was renowned as a screen beauty and character actress
Italian screen actress Virna Lisi, famed in the 1960s for appearing opposite stars including Frank Sinatra, has died at the age of 78.
Lisi, feted for her beauty and blonde locks, carved out a successful career in Hollywood, starring in films such as How To Murder Your Wife.
She was a force in European cinema, winning best actress at Cannes for 1994 French historical epic La Reine Margot.
The last of her movies was made in her native Italy in 2002.
However, Lisi had been due to make a return to the screen in Italian comedy Latin Lover, which is due to be released next year.
Lisi's love affair with Hollywood ended with a fear that she was being typecast as the dumb blonde, leading her to terminate her contract with Paramount film studios in the late 1960s.
Virna Lisi's famous cake-popping moment in How To Murder Your Wife
The actress won awards for playing Catherine de Medici in La Reine Margot
Her role in comedy How To Murder Your Wife, opposite Jack Lemmon, saw her pop out of a wedding cake clad in a bikini in one famous scene.
Lisi also appeared in Assault on a Queen opposite Sinatra in 1966 and performed alongside Tony Curtis in Not With My Wife, You Don't in the same year.
She turned down the role in director Roger Vadim's classic Barbarella, eventually filled by Jane Fonda, leading to a break from acting during the early 1970s.
Later on in her career, she was awarded an honorary Italian Golden Globe award in 2004 in recognition of her cinematic achievements.
The actress was regularly lauded in her homeland for her work, winning seven David di Donatella awards in the 1980s and 90s, culminating in a special honour in 2009.
She had begun her film career as a teenager in the early 1950s with a string of roles in Italian movies.
Lisi is survived by a son, Corrado, and three grandchildren. Her husband of 53 years, Italian architect Franco Pesci, died last year.

"37","George III drawing is uncovered","An eccentric architectural plan thought to have been drawn by King George III during his period of ""madness"" is discovered at the British Library.","George III 'eccentric' drawing uncovered at British Library
By Rebecca Jones Arts correspondent, BBC News
George III's drawing is described as 'rather savage' in style
Was George III a manic depressive?
An eccentric architectural plan thought to have been drawn by George III during his period of ""madness"" has been discovered at the British Library.
It is part of a huge collection of papers put together by the King during his reign from 1760 to 1820.
The loose piece of paper was tucked inside a volume about the Palaces of Hanover in Germany.
The diagram of a building was drawn in ink over a pencil outline ""in a rather savage way"", according to experts.
Peter Barber, head of map collections at the British Library, said the drawing, scribbled on the back of an order of service from St George's Chapel in Windsor, was ""not an ordered plan"".
""You see certain things which are at the very least odd and actually rather disturbing,"" he added.
A grand central courtyard with no obvious means of access, surrounded by no fewer than four monumental staircases, was ""perhaps a little excessive, even for a Baroque monarch"", Mr Barber said.
Meanwhile, some of the rooms have no doors at all, and there is no way of getting from one room to the next.
Peter Barber of The British Library and the BBC's Rebecca Jones study the drawing
Mr Barber concluded that it was drawn when George III's mind was disturbed.
Numerous theories have been given for the sovereign's ""madness"" , from the blood disorder porphyria to episodes of mania corresponding to Bipolar depressive illness.
""It may be a unique survivor of that traumatic period of his life,"" he said.
Martin Clayton, head of prints and drawings at the Royal Collection Trust, agreed.
He said the ""style"" of the drawing was the strongest evidence that it was by George III, being very similar to many other ""scribbled architectural plans"" made by the King.
""It's enthusiastic, it's slightly obsessive in places. And the obsessiveness does suggest that it was probably the work of George III around 1788 or 1789 when he was recovering from his illness.""
The handwriting also strongly resembles that of the monarch.
Secret documents
Mr Clayton believes the plan was a study for the re-development of The White House at Kew, one of a string of royal residences around Richmond and Kew that were built during the 18th Century.
He said contemporaries reported that the King spent a good deal of time ""drawing plans somewhat manically for rebuilding the house, while recovering from his first serious illness"".
The architectural floor plan is part of the King's Topographical Collection. He was a keen armchair traveller, fascinated by geography and a passionate collector.  He brought together more than 60,000 maps, views and watercolours from all over the world, particularly Great Britain and the British Empire.
There are some of the earliest views of Canada, created on birch bark, and there are the first known watercolours of Sydney to be painted by a professional artist.
Nigel Hawthorne portrayed George III on both screen and stage
It also contains a map of New York that was presented to the Duke of York to celebrate the city's capture by the English from the Dutch in 1664. It was, according to Peter Barber, ""the birth certificate of New York"".
The collection also includes highly sensitive and secret government documents for English fortifications around the world, which Mr Barber says should not have been in the King's possession.
""Had they been discovered, England would have been in danger,"" he said.
""They would be sent to him for approval, he would see something interesting and, I think, without asking anybody, he would simply keep them for himself.""

Illness from drinking contaminated water is just the latest affliction affecting civilians in Mosul, months after the Iraqi city was taken over by Islamic State (IS) militants. IS took control of Mosul in June, introducing a strict regime in line with its radical interpretation of Islamic law.

With the mobile phone network still out of action, it was with extreme difficulty that my sister let me know that she was extremely sick.
This has become another chore to add to the list”
End Quote
I rushed to her house on the other side of one of the city's bridges. Peering at the Euphrates, I said to my husband: ""Even this river is unclear! When will our situation clear up so that our water clears again?""
Eventually we reached my sister's house, but she was in extreme pain. We rushed her to the city's hospital, which was extremely overcrowded, with people with similar symptoms.
As soon as we inquired, we were told there was an outbreak of poisoning across the city. The only common factor was the water.
'Harder and harder'
It turned out my sister was suffering from water poisoning, mainly from the water that is pumped into the city from the eastern and western pumping stations.
With water purifiers scarce, the stations had been pumping water into the houses through the pipes, without purification or filtration.
I saw one of our relatives in the hospital - they were also suffering from water poisoning. It dawned on me that the state of the water in the Euphrates that I saw crossing that bridge was the same as when it reached our homes.
This was all followed by a sharp rise in the price of bottled water. One of two water bottling factories in the city is closed due to the owner's absence, and the other is working with limited capacity - plus roads to Kurdistan, where you can buy bottled water, are all blocked.
As we returned home I was agitated thinking about my sister and the whole situation. I know that IS does not care whether our water is filtered or not, so I found myself trying to filter our own water at home mainly by boiling it.
This has become another chore to add to the list, as life under the Islamic State becomes harder and harder.

Our suffering due to the water shortage has turned into a state of fear that won't go away.
My husband goes on to the roof every day to see if the water tanks have been filled by the electrical pump from the main water supply.
We kept hearing explosions for over three hours”
End Quote
On one unforgettably terrifying night, I decided to go on to the roof with my husband to help him.
We suddenly heard a loud explosion followed by loud voices from the nearby street.
We quietly and carefully shifted to peer at the road where we heard the explosion and the voices.
We saw a group of Islamic State fighters shooting in the air, and I feared for my husband because they were banging on doors searching for men in the area in order to question them.
Trembling with fear
It turned out that the explosion was caused by a bomb planted on one of the IS vehicles.
Within a few seconds the terrifying sound of fighter jets filled the sky, and they starting bombing IS fighters.
IS vehicles were full of ammunition and we kept hearing explosions for over three hours.
I was trembling with fear for my husband and my children and dreading the sound of the doorbell. But thankfully the aerial bombardment caused a great deal of confusion among IS fighters, and they didn't knock on our door.
When the sun rose we managed to see the extent of the damage to the houses and the street caused by the bombing.
We decided to leave our house and stay at a relative's place for a few days because I was afraid for my family.

From Nizar
We have been shocked by the outage of the Asiacell mobile phone network, the main provider in the city. It has left me in a terrible state because, like everyone else, my business depends on communication. In fact, everyone in Mosul depends on it for that matter.
People gather on a hill in Mosul to try to get a mobile phone signal
A few hours after the network went down, others such as Korek, Zain and Fanous followed.
It's left the city in a complete void, like we've gone back to the dark ages.
We have to rely on people around us and local internet providers for communication.
'Not knowing'
Everybody was confused by what happened and we were all asking each other, trying to find out when the service would be back. Some blamed the blackout on the government in Baghdad and others on Islamic State - either way, the city is lost.
The worst part is there is no real alternative, so if you need to speak to someone you'd have to go to find them at their home or workplace, assuming they were there in the first place.
That happened to me as I was trying to locate a merchant I do business with, who in turn was looking for another person to settle some financial accounts, and I waited and waited, but without success.
I then returned home to take my sick father to the doctor's clinic, also not knowing whether the doctor would be there or not. I was, however, lucky and managed to sort out my family and work affairs - albeit with great difficulty.
We don't know how long this will last or whether we should start getting used to it as a way of life.
From Faisal
My mother called me asking me whether I could buy her a gas canister to replace the one at home as it had run out.
I took the empty canister and drove to a shop downtown, only to discover that the price for a replacement was more than 60 Iraqi dinars ($50).
How can we continue living under this caliphate”
End Quote
I was in complete shock. Before IS took control, the price was barely $7, but with IS it just kept on rising.
I came back home thinking how would I ever be able to afford it given our tight financial situation. After debating with my mother, we decided it was better if I went back and bought one anyway as life at our home depends on such a necessary item, for cooking, for example.
Forced to shut
I went back the next morning to discover that its price had gone up to $100 - and there were no canisters for sale in sight!
I rushed back home in a panic, but decided I'd better buy some lunch from a restaurant on the way because we didn't have fuel to cook.
The restaurant was shut. When I asked why, I was told the owner couldn't afford the ever-increasing cost of new gas canisters - so he had to shut the whole place down!
Thirteen restaurant employees were laid off - that's 13 families who can no longer earn bread, all because of the price of a gas canister. In fact, most restaurants have had to shut, apart from a few which have a stock of gas.
Others have resorted to burning wood, using very expensive electric heaters, or stoves that run on oil.
We are tired of this situation - there is no clean water, fuel or gas to cook our food.
How can we continue living under this caliphate?
Mosul profile
How can I use this new currency which is only recognised in IS territory?! ”
End Quote
He said that a group of pious and highly religious men from IS had decided to mint a new gold coin and new coins made of silver and copper in addition to new paper notes which will be used in the markets in the near future.
He also said that another group of pious IS youth organised an advertising campaign to announce the use of the new currency.
The aim was to make the new Islamic dinar a force to be reckoned with against the US dollar used by the infidels, as the imam said, in what turned out to be the same sermon forced by IS on all the mosques.
Panic-selling
I went home feeling worried and confused. I have business and bank accounts and bank dealings with other countries. How can I use this new currency which is only recognised in IS territory?!
The IS dinar was going to replace the official Iraqi currency and use of the dollar was going to be banned. I didn't know what to do, and I sat with a group of friends to discuss what would happen to our money and to our business.
Everybody agreed they would exchange the existing Iraqi currency for US dollars or for gold jewellery.
We all agreed that the IS plan was not religious or ideological as they said, but merely a scheme to rob us of our money and savings.
The next morning a state of chaos gripped the market as everybody was trying to get rid of the Iraqi dinar and to buy dollars or gold.
21 November 2014
From Faisal
Once upon a time in our land, which is rich with water and oil, we used to have a big supply of water and electricity. However, now in the time of the IS caliphate, we lead the most difficult life imaginable.
We don't have water because the supply station does not work most of the time due to a power shortage.
We dug a well to find enough water for our needs”
End Quote
We collect rainwater in the garden, and my mum tries to save the rain falling on the roof through the gutter in order to use it for the laundry and cleaning.
Winter came early, and the cold is really harsh. Hot water is one of the most basic requirements of winter in Iraq, but how can we have hot water? We haven't had any electricity supply from our national provider for a month or more!
We totally rely on private generators. Life would have been impossible in my beloved city without them.
My neighbours tried to find a solution to the water shortage, so we dug a well to find enough water for our needs during the continuous shortage of water supply.
Digging water wells became very prevalent in Mosul, and everybody is digging for water in my country that boasts two major rivers.
We now try to save kerosene for heating, although it's very scarce and expensive.  The price of a barrel is about $250, although its price on the international markets is no more than $100.
But this is not surprising because we live in Iraq, the land of miracles.

They completely banned the use of colours and coloured pens in school”
End Quote
He is Egyptian, and his main focus was separating girls from boys in primary schools. According to his instructions, girls go to one building and boys to another. He gave his instructions that girls who look a bit mature for their age should wear loose-fitting garments and a face veil.
Male teachers are not allowed to teach girls and women teachers are not allowed to teach boys. This decision is very difficult to be implemented by public schools and more so for the private ones.
Public schools are funded by the education authority and the ministry of education, and they have a large supply of teachers - male and female - and a lot of buildings.
Private schools, on the other hand, are educational and commercial projects owned by private individuals who do not have the resources to supply the teachers and the buildings.
This means that the demand for private schools will decrease in a time when job opportunities are very scarce and money is hard to come by.
'They cancelled art'
School syllabuses have been changes by IS. There are no physical education classes anymore. Instead there is ""jihadi education"", which is a subject in which students are taught to love jihad [an Islamic concept meaning ""struggle""] and how to do so.
IS cancelled both geography and history lessons, but then they changed their mind. They cancelled art classes, and instead teach Arabic calligraphy. They completely banned the use of colours and coloured pens in schools.
All these matter make the running of schools very difficult, even impossible, especially banning students from activities, such as sports and painting, that mean the world to them.
5 November 2014
From Nizar
[Editor's note: Before Islamic State overran Mosul, the city was home to one of the oldest Christian communities in the world. Most fled with the arrival of IS, who ordered the city's remaining Christians to convert to Islam, pay a religious tax, or face being killed.]
Not one house owned by a Christian in Mosul was not taken over and looted by IS members, and all their belongings stolen, down to the last broomstick.
I cannot bear to look at their evil faces”
End Quote
Some IS fighters have even moved into the Christians' homes themselves, using everything in those houses as if they were their own.
They've inhabited all the areas and consider them as spoils of war, as if the Christians and the Yazidis [minority religious group] were the enemy, and by doing so, the IS has become a burden on our areas.
We feel ashamed to call our Christian and Yazidi friends, and I feel I cannot even phone them any more, as if it was me or one of my family or friends that committed those heinous crimes against them.
I decided not to talk or salute any IS member who occupies a Christian house near me, and I cannot bear to look at their evil faces.
Fleeing air strikes
I've taken notice of their behaviour during coalition air strikes. They immediately switch off the lights in the homes they occupy, and some drive off in their stolen cars in some unknown direction.
Then they return as soon as the air strikes cease. A friend of mine had the nerve to ask one of them: ""Why do you run away during the air strikes?""
The IS member answered that they fear the strikes will target the houses of Christians that they've occupied because the Christians would have told the coalition their location.
Another friend of mine tried to get close to a house occupied by an IS member and his family to see what was happening there, but he was unable to as they never leave the door open, and don't even talk in the garden.
My friends and I vowed that once this is over, and our city is cleared of the dirt and nastiness, that we would rehabilitate a Christian house to show the world, or at least our Christian friends, that those who did this to them abide by no religion at all.
24 October 2014
From Faisal
Four months have passed since Islamic State took over, and a friend of mine is still in hiding here.
He worked as a bodyguard for some judges in Mosul, but after the city fell all the judges left and my friend went into hiding. He moved home so no-one would know where to find him.
Their criminal acts have terrorised peaceful citizens”
End Quote
My friend doesn't move around in the streets much, because IS fighters are almost everywhere in the city.
Sometimes they set up impromptu checkpoints and go through people's IDs, looking for people wanted by IS: former security personnel or judiciary, or anyone suspected of arresting IS members before IS captured the city, or anyone who worked for the governorate or in politics.
Most of them have left, fearing execution by IS. These kinds of actions have pushed people away from supporting IS. Their criminal acts have terrorised peaceful citizens.
IS members can be seen executing activists in front of everyone in the streets. They wear black fighter outfits, have let their hair and beards grow - some look as if they haven't seen a shower in ages!
Every day they increase in number, hold new positions and consolidate their presence, undeterred by the air strikes from coalition forces which do nothing to change things on the ground. It it is actually our reality which has changed and become even more horrific.
From Mays
I teach at a school in my beloved  city, Mosul. Like other Iraqi mothers I work to provide some sort of financial assistance to my husband, albeit negligible, to help fend off the hardships of life through such hard times and in such an expensive country.
This year, when the summer holidays began, I decided to go to Baghdad to visit some family and relatives there and attend a family ceremony.
After the party, when we were all still full of excitement and surrounded by our loved ones, I received news of a curfew back home, and the start of the fighting between government forces and Islamic State rebels.
From that moment I spoke to my husband in Mosul every day to find out the latest news.
'Horror and panic'
I spent the worst days of my life in Baghdad, the city of my childhood innocence, and where I lived my dreams as a woman in my 20s. I had always been thrilled to live in Baghdad until I got married and moved to Mosul.
Those were moments I will never forget”
End Quote
And yet, for five days of fighting which followed in Mosul, I lived in horror, fear and pure panic, worrying about my husband. I was constantly wondering what was happening and whether I would ever be with him again.
After the arrival of the Sunni rebels and IS fighters in Mosul, my husband and I started plotting my return to the city, but all roads were still blocked because of the fighting taking place between Baghdad and Mosul.
Cities were falling in hours - not even days - after governmental forces fled or retreated, which left everybody puzzled.
After several attempts by my husband and thanks to some of his connections, we managed to book flights from Baghdad to the north.
But then another obstacle faced us - I had not brought my children's documentation as I was travelling by land. Yet as we were now flying, it was a must, or we wouldn't be able to leave.
Armed groups
Thanks to good thinking and God's will we received the documents via a friend who was leaving Mosul by car and who later flew to Baghdad and brought us the papers.
I finally got home to my family in Mosul, shortly after midnight on 20 June. I was shocked and frightened by what I saw in the streets, where armed groups were roaming around. I prayed and fasted for three days.
I stayed at home for a while, until I got used to the situation we are now living under, but those were moments I will never forget.

Joseph Warungu: Gagging order?
In our series of letters from African journalists, Nigerian writer and novelist Adaobi Tricia Nwaubani looks at the clamour for assistance that accompanies a politician's rise to office.
The political party primaries in Nigeria have drawn to a close and voters now have a clearer picture of whose turn it might be to divide up the national cake after the elections in February 2015.
But the winning candidates won't be the only ones taking their share of the country's riches.
In Nigeria, news of a person's success in an election often travels at the speed of lightning, over rivers and mountains and past fields and forests, to his kindred in all corners of the globe.
Those with no jobs believe their days of unemployment are coming to an end; those with no education think it will soon pose no barrier to climbing the corporate ladder; those in faraway lands begin plans to return home.
Soon, these kith and kin launch their pilgrimage towards the successful candidate.
They ring his phone; they send text messages; they knock at his gate.
They offer to help his campaign in any way they can; they organise prayer sessions for his victory, usually late at night in his living room.
“Start Quote
The most unforgivable sin a politician can commit is to forget 'his people' after he assumes office”
End Quote Adaobi Tricia Nwaubani
'Bitter tongues will wag'
A friend of mine who lives in Lagos told me last week that he was travelling to Benin state.
His friend had just ""picked up"" a spot in the House of Assembly there. Another person he knew was set for another top position.
""He's a good friend of my elder brother in Florida,"" he said. ""I've already told my brother: 'You'd better come down and rub minds with him and introduce us to him.'""
Another friend whose husband is a close associate of a winning candidate in one of Nigeria's choicest states told me her phone did not stop ringing after his victory was announced.
People had been calling to offer congratulations. Indeed, even I had called for that very reason.
In Nigeria, the culture has always been that anyone who gets into power, who suddenly finds himself holding a knife with which to cut the national cake, must invite his clan to both slice and eat it with him.
Friends and family of candidates take to the streets to celebrate if their man is triumphant at the polls
The most unforgivable sin a politician can commit is to forget ""his people"" after he assumes office.
He must ""remember"" his sisters, brothers, cousins, nieces, nephews, in-laws, friends, schoolmates, and so on.
Preferably through contracts, appointments and jobs.
Failure to do so will lead to taunts and ostracism and on the day his tenure expires, he will find himself completely alone.
Long after his funeral, the bitter tongues will continue wagging.
Local history will forever record him as having denied his kindred their turn.
I have heard several amusing stories regarding the influx of people from the Niger Delta region into Abuja, the Nigerian capital, after their kinsman, Goodluck Jonathan, was elected president in 2011.
Outstretched palms
One of my favourite tales was told by my British-Nigerian friend who teaches in one of those Abuja schools where the children pay stupendous fees in dollars and make fun of their teachers' cheap mobile phones.
She was shocked when a particular pupil, during a science lesson, seemed to know more about crustaceans than you would expect of a child his age in the city.
This child stood before the class and described in great detail how the creatures are caught, cleaned and cooked.
It will be tough for Nigeria to tackle its corruption problem while people demand rewards for their votes
At the end, my friend called the boy aside and asked how he knew so much about the topic.
The child explained that he had grown up in the creeks, where his family petty-traded crustaceans for a living.
That is why the news of a candidate's potential ascension into political office stirs such joy.
In many parts of the world, it requires years of steady progress for one's economic circumstances to radically transform.
Here in Nigeria, all it takes is an election, and a new political appointment. Suddenly, a child goes from capturing crustaceans in the creeks to an exclusive school in Abuja.
Voracious kith and kin are the main force behind Nigeria's corruption problem.
Imagine the thousands lined up with outstretched palms behind each political office holder.
Try telling them that you intend to reform the system now that it is finally their turn to eat.

"48","De-radicalising Sweden's neo-Nazis","Deradicalising Sweden's neo-Nazis","Swedish neo-Nazis: Moves to de-radicalise amid far-right rise
By Stuart Hughes BBC News, Stockholm
Swedish extremists attacked an anti-Nazi protest in Stockholm last December
Sweden's Syrian asylum offer
Sweden's normally sedate political system was thrown into turmoil this month when the Sweden Democrats - a populist party with a stridently anti-immigration agenda - brought down the minority coalition after it had been in power for just two-and-a-half months, by refusing to support its budget plans.
Now the third largest party in Sweden's parliament, it has moved away from its roots in the extreme-right scene to become a more mainstream, though highly controversial, political force. New elections are due in March.
But Sweden is still home to an active and at times violent neo-Nazi movement, and there are fears that rising popularity of the Sweden Democrats will also benefit the extremists.
Nazi techniques
Johan - he asked not to use his real name - was drawn towards the far right as a teenager growing up in a middle-class Stockholm family.
His friends split into two groups. One faction began experimenting with drugs. The other became skinheads.
Johan spent time in jail after he joined the neo-Nazi Swedish Resistance Movement as a teenager
It led him to become a member of one of Europe's most notorious and violent neo-Nazi organisations, the Swedish Resistance Movement.
""I was just angry. I was carrying a lot of anger around,"" Johan says.
""I couldn't get my head around school, so fighting seemed attractive to me. That's what got me into the movement. That's what I enjoyed.""
Johan admits some of the group's beliefs made him uneasy, especially when members began practising techniques used in Nazi Germany.
""They started measuring skulls and I felt it was too much,"" he says. ""They measured the heads of people to decide who was Aryan and who wasn't.""
Sweden's immigration policy
Sept 2013: Sweden offers permanent residency to all Syrian asylum seekers
Jan-Nov 2014: 74,347 asylum applications - increase of more than 20,000 on 2013
Second highest number in EU after Germany
The Swedish Resistance Movement regards its political enemies as fair game.
Johan says he was encouraged to carry a weapon on the streets.
After pulling a gun during a fight he was arrested and sentenced to two-and-a-half years in prison.
In the 1990s, Sweden established itself as Europe's centre for racist and anti-Semitic music and propaganda.
In response, a pioneering project, Exit Sweden, was established to support those looking for a way out of the movement. It took its inspiration from a de-radicalisation model developed in Norway.
""The far-right movement is very good at channelling difficult emotions - hatred, shame, being afraid - by making it into aggression,"" Exit Sweden's director Robert Orell, told me.
""What we try to do is to look at what is happening within you, why do these different situations or thoughts or events trigger aggression - and what could you do instead?""
In the suburb of Karrtorp, a few subway stops south of central Stockholm, I met Daniel Poohl, editor-in-chief of investigative magazine Expo.
Karrtorp was the scene of violent clashes in December 2013 between members of the Swedish Resistance Movement and protesters who were demonstrating against the appearance of racist graffiti and propaganda in the neighbourhood.
Editor Daniel Poohl fears the imminent election campaign will lead to an increase in racist debate
Daniel Poohl fears the rise of the Sweden Democrats could make it easier for extremist ideologies to thrive.
""I'm worried because the far right has more self confidence than in all the years I've been trying to explain them,"" he says.
""We have a coming election which I fear will be the most nasty election ever when it comes to how people in this society are described, where racist ideas will pop up at workplaces, at parties, as something you suddenly can say and it's OK.
""That scares me.""
Exit Sweden encourages its clients to engage in new interests such as sport and music to replace the adrenaline rush they once gained from street fighting.
But the Exit model has its critics.
Exit Sweden, based in Stockholm, took its inspiration from a Norwegian de-radicalisation model
Liz Fekete from the Institute of Race Relations in London believes its non-judgmental approach allows individuals to skirt around past actions without having to take full responsibility for them.
""The ethos is not to look at the neo-Nazis' ideology, it tends to look at their grievances,"" she says.
""They come saying they're frightened to leave the scene, there are all these problems that they've had in their social background. So there is a sense that they are the victims and in that context there's not a focus on what they have done.""
Johan says he does not dwell on the years he spent as a member of the Swedish Resistance Movement now that he has broken away with Exit's help.
He says he no longer needs the black-and-white certainties that the White Power movement gave him. Like the swastika tattoo on his wrist that has almost disappeared after painful laser treatment, those too have faded.
But the direction that this country, which prides itself on tolerance, will take after the election next March is far less certain.

By Rajini Vaidyanathan BBC News, Washington
Christingle: The Christmas tradition that only got going in the 1960s
Mass shootings at schools and universities in the United States in recent years have put the issue of firearms on campuses at the centre of the gun debate. Many say the lesson is to keep campuses gun-free, but a growing number of students argue if they were allowed to carry guns at college, they'd feel safer.
A former beauty pageant contestant from California, 20-year-old Taylor Woolrich is the first to admit she's not your usual guns rights campaigner.
She's fighting for the right to carry a weapon on campus, for a very personal reason.
For years she's been stalked by a man she first came into contact with while waitressing at a cafe.
He would turn up to see her every day and began to track her down outside work. An emergency restraining order failed to deter him.
Things became even more terrifying when she moved across the country to study at Dartmouth college in New Hampshire.
""It wasn't even on my mind, and then he contacted me via LinkedIn and used social media to continue to contact me - sent me various very frightening messages, making it very specific he knew where I was,"" she says.
One summer, when she went home to California, he turned up at her parents' doorstep. She says police found what they call a ""rape kit"" - rope tied as a slip-noose, gloves, duct-tape, flash light, and a sweatshirt - inside his car.
Taylor's stalker is currently in jail. His sentence will soon be up.
Taylor Woolrich is fighting to carry a gun on campus
He's due to face trial soon on further charges relating to her case. Still, Taylor is desperately frightened that he could be released, or allowed out on bail. She's certain that if that happened, he would be able to find her.
For that reason, she wants the right to carry a gun on her university premises, arguing it's the only way she could overpower him if the pair came face to face.
""I carry mace, I've considered a Taser, I've considered many options,"" she says. ""Whatever he's going to do, it's going to be worse than the possibility of him grabbing my gun and turning it on me.""
Dartmouth College has refused to comment on this specific case due to privacy laws, but says the safety and security of all students is a top priority for them. Any student who reports being stalked is given personalised and heightened protection. On top of this, safety improvements are made, as and when they are needed, says a spokesman.
Your rights shouldn't change once you step inside the campus.”
End Quote Crayle Vanest Students For Concealed Carry
Like the vast number of colleges and universities across the country, Dartmouth has a policy which prohibits handguns on campus.
The laws on guns on campuses vary from state to state. In more than half of the country, it's up to the universities themselves to decide weapons policy. In New Hampshire, where Dartmouth is located, the decision is left to the college, which chose to keep its campus gun free.
Many institutions believe that allowing weapons on campus has the potential to inflame tense situations, rather than diffuse them.
The American Association of State Colleges and Universities (AASCU) has stated, ""Even with the best of intentions, armed students or employees could escalate an already explosive situation further, accidentally cause harm or use a gun in a situation that is not warranted.""
This month however, a Florida legislator brought forth a bill calling to allow students to carry guns on campus. He cited a recent campus shooting at Florida State University as a reason students need firearms.
A national group, Students For Concealed Carry, is also calling for the right for students to have a concealed weapon. It would mean they could have a gun in their bag at university, but wouldn't be able display it on a holster.
Crayle Vanest is Midwest regional director for the group. A student at Indiana University, she got her first rifle at the age of 14 for sport, before getting her concealed carry permit.
""As soon as you walk into the doors of a university you should still be able to carry your gun if you have a licence,"" she says.
""Your rights shouldn't change once you step inside the campus.""
Vanest says her organisation has attracted many women.
Like the vast number of colleges and universities across the US, Dartmouth prohibits handguns on campus.
""We want to protect ourselves on campus which is an area where women are very frequently victimised.""
But just as there are groups advocating for students to carry guns, there are many who call for the opposite, arguing that the presence of weapons exacerbates violence on campus.
""Having access to guns only increases the chances of an innocent person being hit, versus actually hitting a target or a person who's trying to stalk you,"" argues Jamira Burley, a member of the Generation Progress, Gun Violence Network.
Burley also cites the high levels of suicide among college students as another reason for guns to be banned from places of education. She says 85% of suicide attempts using guns are fatal, compared with only 2% who attempt a drug overdose.
For Taylor, the right to bear arms isn't about exercising a constitutional right, it's about staying safe.
""What else am I supposed to do? What other option is there? I've tried everything, I've obeyed all the laws,"" she says. ,""I've never responded to a single message, I've stayed away, I've gone to school 35,000 miles away from my home town, my parents have sold their home and moved,"" she says.
""There's no other option.""

How are Venezuelans coping with tumbling oil prices?
The Venezuelan government will have to do some blue sky thinking to get the economy back on track
Venezuela's inflation rises to 63.4%
Falling global oil prices have been a headache for many oil-producing countries, with exports now failing to bring in cash they used to just six months ago.
On Thursday, the price of Brent crude was just below $63 a barrel, while US crude was near $58.
The price of Venezuelan oil, which is very heavy by international standards, was even lower - at $57.53 a barrel for the week ending 13 December.
The dramatic downward slide started in June.
Six months of falling prices have hit Venezuela particularly hard - the country is heavily dependent on oil money, with 96% of export revenues coming from oil, according to reports .
BBC News has been speaking to a selection of Venezuelans on the streets of Caracas to find out how they have been personally affected by the fall in oil prices.
Oil down, goods up
Alex Hernandez, a businessman in Caracas, says the problem is exacerbated by a lack of foreign currency.
Businessman Alex Hernandez says the fall in oil prices means there is not enough foreign currency to import goods
In 2003, the Venezuelan government set a fixed rate for foreign currency exchange.
The move was designed to keep government control over prices and to make certain basic items, such as bread and rice, more affordable to the poor.
Under the currency controls, people and businesses can receive US dollars at the official rate only by applying to a government currency agency, and then only for the purpose of importing goods or to pay for foreign travel.
Mr Hernandez believes the fall in oil prices has made it even harder for businessmen like himself to get hold of the foreign currency needed to buy the imported goods he sells.
A falling oil price means fewer dollars flowing into Venezuela's government coffers, and less to spend on paying for imports.
As Mr Hernandez mentioned, prices for goods in Venezuela have been rising
The most recent official figures put the inflation rate at 63.4% .
The figures were the first Venezuela's central bank had released since May, which led critics to accuse the government of withholding data for political reasons.
Neither did the central bank publish its scarcity index, a measure of goods that are missing from store shelves, but it is clear the difficulty of getting hold of basic products is a source of discontent for many.
Daily hunt
Housewife Eugenia Martinez says she sometimes has to queue all day to get what she needs for her family. She says the queues have got longer and longer as the price of oil has tumbled.
Eugenia Martinez queues all day to get the products she needs for her family
Mechanic Enrique Moreno says his business is also hit by the scarcity of replacement parts. But in his view, the situation cannot just be blamed on the falling oil prices.
Mr Moreno believes that given Venezuela's riches the country should be a lot better off than it is, even if the current price per barrel is low.
Mechanic Enrique Moreno thinks mismanagement rather than low oil prices are the problem
Mr Moreno says he can feel a general mood of unhappiness in the streets of Caracas.
That mood is reflected by opinion polls which suggest the approval rating for President Nicolas Maduro has been falling along with falling oil prices.
Venezuela's generous social programmes are largely financed through oil revenue.
The government is reluctant to cut them back - both out of an ideological commitment to the legacy of its late socialist leader, Hugo Chavez, and out of the knowledge that a drastic cut could erode the support of those Venezuelans who voted the government into power.
With Venezuela's credit rating lowered on Thursday by three notches to CCC, the country is getting closer to default.
And with no sign of oil prices rising, the headache for its government of how to counter the drop in revenue looks set to get worse.

In pictures: Bangladesh oil spill clean-up
An oil spill from a crashed tanker in Bangladesh's Sundarbans waterways is threatening a rare dolphin sanctuary and part of the world's largest mangrove forest.
Despite the threat to the environment and people's livelihoods, some local residents are also finding ways to make money from the clean-up efforts.
Thousands of litres of oil leaked into Sundarbans' waterways following a collision involving a tanker. Much of the surrounding environment is now toxic.
The tanker, believed to be carrying 350,000 litres (75,000 gallons) of oil, collided with another vessel on 9 December. It has now been brought to shore.
The oil spill covered nearly 40 miles (60km) of waterways. At low tide, oil marks are still clearly visible on the mangrove trees inside the Sundarban Forest.
The spill has affected the people who have homes by the Sela River and make a living from the waterways.
Many people continue to use water from the river for their daily household needs, despite the risks to their health.
The Forest Department has engaged local people to help with clean-up efforts.
Villagers have been scooping oil from the rivers using pots and pans.
The people who usually fish in the Sela River are now busy collecting the oil.
It has become a source of income for many. Some of the oil is put into drums and sold to a state-owned oil company after it is collected.
Dead plants collected from the forest are also being boiled in an effort to extract some oil for sale.
It can be a lucrative business. For some, collection of oil has become more profitable than fishing.
Cargo vessels are forced to wait on Pashur River while the clean-up is under way.
The Sundarbans area contains part of the world's largest mangrove forest. But locals say mangroves by the river bank are going to die, as oil from the spillage has covered their roots.

"52","Budapest's underground escape craze","The underground escape games taking Hungary by storm","The secrets behind Hungary's escape games craze
By Lucy Hooker Business reporter, BBC News, Budapest
Zoltan Kovacs takes you behind the scenes at a Trap escape game
Hungary's entrepreneurial spirit
Being locked in a dingy cellar for an hour with fiendishly difficult problems to solve isn't everyone's idea of fun. But in the Hungarian capital Budapest, ""escape room games"" are luring in tourists and locals alike. So what's the appeal?
If I'm honest I can't make head nor tail of the drawing in front of me. It looks like a plumbing diagram.
And while it's clear that the sequence of noises - a church bell ringing, a frog croaking, a cat mewling - are code for something, I am none the wiser.
I'm in a dimly lit cellar, furnished with creaking chairs, broken toys, and old computer monitors. The low-arched brick ceilings have been whitewashed, but there are few other concessions to civilisation.
Peeling paint and low lighting add to the atmosphere
But sometimes it's hard to tell what is a clue and what is just part of the sinister decor
Continue reading the main story
“Start Quote
There is a theory that because we were closed off from the rest of the world we turned towards games”
End Quote Zoltan Kovacs Founder of Trap
With time pressure mounting it's vital that my team and I piece together some kind of logic among the junk, if we want to make an escape. That's the challenge. Identify each puzzle in the room, unravel its mystery in turn and you may get out before your allotted hour is up.
But still ringing in my ears are the words of owner Attila Gyurkovics before he locked us in: ""Getting out is not guaranteed.""
Hidden objects
Parapark was Budapest's first escape room game, based on the timeless truth that everyone relishes a challenge.
For just over 8,000 forints (£20) a team of up to five people has 60 minutes of complete distraction from the real world above. And despite Attila's ominous tone there is no real price to pay, except frustration, if he has to unlock the door for you in the end.
After wrestling with puzzle pieces, a broken doll and intermittent blackouts we're eventually free and Attila, a former social worker, tells me how the idea for Parapark occurred to him just over three years ago.
Attila Gyurkovics came up with the escape game three years ago
""I was playing computer games - hidden object games - with my girlfriend,"" he says.
He noticed how absorbing they were, how despite their artifice, he was so swept along he stopped noticing the time passing.
""After a while I thought, 'That's what we have to do in real life.'""
Faded grandeur
Since Parapark opened its doors in 2011, Hungarians have taken the concept and run with it.
In Budapest it is estimated there are now about 60 different escape games.
The themes are pleasingly varied, including joining Alice down the rabbit hole, racing to defuse a suitcase bomb and being trapped in a psychiatric ward.
There's one obvious reason why Budapest is the crucible for this burst of creativity.
Many Budapest properties are in need of renovation
The streets are lined with majestic Habsburg era townhouses. But their grandeur is fading. Chunks of plaster lie in the gutters and broken windows indicate empty properties, even in the city centre.
The financial crisis knocked the wind out of Hungary's property market and you can rent an apartment for just a few hundred dollars a month. A cellar costs even less.
Tomb raiders
""The truth is conditions are ideal here for this game, as if these cellars were made for this,"" admits Zoltan Kovacs, who runs Trap, another escape game company in Budapest.
""The premises are so cheap. It's easy to get a permit. Everything is suitable for making easy money. It's tempting to try it.""
In some ways it's too tempting. The main worry for established businesses like Zoltan's is the explosion of new games, some of which have been thrown together quickly and cheaply to cash in on the craze.
Trap's games are more elaborate than most. The props and puzzles are purpose built from glass, wood and metal, while a sophisticated network of electronic triggers opens up secret passages and new challenges. It takes his team six months and around £8,000 to develop a new game.
Zoltan Kovacs is taking the idea of exit games into businesses and schools
As we're talking a team of foreign students arrives.
One room here is furnished like a medieval castle complete with gallows, an axe and a treasure chest.
But the group is eager to pit their wits in the other game: the ancient Egyptian tomb.
Puzzle masters
So just how smart do you have to be to solve the puzzles? Zoltan claims no specialist knowledge is required beyond secondary school level.
He left school as soon as he could and says if he can solve a puzzle it's not too difficult.
But he did pass his leaving exam, and it's worth noting that Hungary's traditional education system expects students to be proficient in geography, physics and arithmetic.
Moreover Hungary is famous for producing both world-class chess players, and a high number of Nobel Prize winners in maths and science. Houdini was born in Hungary.
Is it possible that Hungarians have a special affinity for these kinds of brainteasers?
""Under communism we were forced to be creative and resourceful,"" says Zoltan.
""There is a theory that because we were closed off from the rest of the world we turned towards games. This is why Erno Rubik invented his cube. We had nothing else left.""
No specialist knowledge required, just a logical mind
Teamwork is key
But that doesn't prevent moments of individual frustration
'Like reality'
The rest of the world is taking to Hungary's games now too.
Copies have begun to spring up in other European cities, almost all offshoots or franchises of Hungarian ones.
Trap is expanding to offer corporate team-building, a mobile game, and versions to use in schools. Zoltan's eyes light up as he describes his idea for a game based on 19th Century inventors such as James Watt and Thomas Edison.
Finally the team of students appears through the exit. They have done rather well, locating secret panels, deciphering hieroglyphs and confronting mummified heads.
And despite the effort, they've enjoyed the experience.
""It's really realistic. That's what makes it special,"" says Manuel from Germany.
""You're really trapped in a room... sometimes when you're into it, it doesn't feel like a game. It feels like reality somehow.""
""You have to try it - because it's Budapest,"" says his French teammate Francois. He shrugs. ""Just try it.""

"53","Viewpoint: Obama secures Latin legacy","Cuba policy secures Obama a Latin legacy","Viewpoint: Obama secures legacy with Cuba policy shift
By Michael Shifter President of Inter-American Dialogue
The policy changes lift restrictions on Cuba in place for more than five decades
America's man in Havana
With the speech outlining a major shift in US-Cuban relations, President Barack Obama secured his legacy in Latin America.
This was the speech most Latin Americans were hoping to hear from a US president for decades - and one many believed they would hear shortly after Obama came to office in 2009.
It took a lame duck session, a president unburdened by concerns about Florida politics, and a worsening economic situation in Cuba to produce the long-awaited change.
To be sure, Obama had already moved in 2009 to lift the restrictions on travel and remittances of Cuban Americans that had been imposed by the George W Bush administration in 2004.
Although those measures were welcome and had some effect, they were mainly on the margins and did not represent any fundamental shift towards engagement.
But on Wednesday Obama sounded a lot like the advocates for policy change on Cuba.
US President Barack Obama announced sweeping changes to US-Cuba policy on Wednesday
He did not just call for punishing Cuba less than before, but rather to end efforts to isolate Cuba diplomatically and squeeze it economically.
Obama made it clear that he is now committed to reversing course and opening up with Cuba in a meaningful way. That means pursuing expanded trade, communication and cooperation.
Although he still has to work within the legislatively mandated embargo, Obama has ample latitude and can build political momentum towards ending the anachronistic policy.
To realise the full potential of the new measures will, however, require some changes in Havana as well.
If the new US-Cuba policies will get the political backing in Washington they need to be sustained and succeed, there will have to be some indication that Cuba is taking steps towards greater political opening.
A look back at the relationship between the two countries through the decades
If the regime cracks down, hardliners in the US Congress will have more ammunition to push back.
The new measures will test the long-held view that the Cuban leadership actually wants and needs the punitive US embargo to justify its absolute political control.
Removing that gift to the regime, the argument goes, will undercut its legitimacy and open things up.
While that view may well have been largely plausible when Fidel Castro was in charge, it is less persuasive in the current moment and under his younger brother Raul´s direction.
Raul Castro has presided over a series of measures of economic opening, including reduction of state employment and the spread of private businesses, but these have moved slowly and have had a number of difficulties, frustrating many Cubans.
Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez has supported Cuba financially
Although one can never be certain, having been in Havana over the last week there is a sense that, out of sheer economic necessity, the Raul Castro government would like to see more open and productive economic relations with the United States.
The Cuban economy is in dire straits and requires infusions of capital that will be hard to attain without significant US engagement.
Cuba's already severe problems have recently been aggravated by Venezuela's unrelenting economic crisis, made much worse by falling oil prices. Cuba has been heavily dependent on Venezuelan largess since Hugo Chavez came to power in 1999.
It is unclear, of course, whether the Obama administration's new measures will contribute to greater political opening and improvements in human rights in Cuba.
But few can argue seriously that the punitive approach, in place for over half a century, helped much on that score. Obama the empiricist believes that if a policy doesn't work it is time to try something else.
No policy, foreign or domestic, better fits that dictum. Also judging by the reaction on the streets of Havana, most Cubans too are relieved that the US-Cuba deadlock is over and could - though not easily or quickly - unleash some positive changes in their country.
Washington's absurd Cuba policy has long stood in the way of a more constructive relationship with Latin America.  No issue has been such a powerful unifying factor across the region.
Cuban President Raul Castro discussed the sweeping changes to US policy with Mr Obama prior to their announcement
This bold move will not eliminate the growing distance between the United States and Latin America, but it is likely to help reduce the distance and open up opportunities for deeper engagement on a range of other issues.
When Obama attends the Summit of the Americas in Panama next April, and meets with his counterparts including Raul Castro, he is expected to be greeted with great warmth and enthusiasm.
Obama may discover that, as he looks across the global geopolitical landscape, with religious wars flaring, he may have more time for Latin America in his remaining two years in office.

"54","Putin's news conference: Five things we learned","Five things we learned from Putin's annual review","Putin's news conference: Five things we learned
By Bridget Kendall Diplomatic correspondent, BBC News
President Putin reassured Russians that they would weather the difficulties
Russian President Vladimir Putin has been speaking at his end-of-year news conference.
Over the course of three hours, he discussed the economy, Ukraine, the opposition - and his love life.
Here are five things we learnt.
Belt-tightening ahead
Russians are paying more for imported goods because of the plunging rouble
Judging by Mr Putin's forecast, Russians can expect the current rocky ride to continue: the collapse in oil prices and plummeting rouble are due to ""external factors"" which may go on for two years.
But the vulnerable will be looked after: food prices and pensions will be protected. And big spending plans to upgrade Russia's armed forces, invest in infrastructure and prepare for the 2018 World Cup in Russia will be shaved, not shelved.
Anyway, if a cheaper rouble means more expensive imports that is to be welcomed, in Mr Putin's view. He believes the only way Russia can grow stronger and safer is to rely less on foreigners and more on itself.
""Only a strong Russian state can protect the interests of Russian citizens,"" he said, after telling a cautionary tale of an offshore Russian company whose money was blocked because of Western sanctions.
For jittery markets, there were two concrete takeaways. First, a reassurance that it would not be right to take the drastic step of imposing planning capital controls - at least not yet.
Second, the news that a prominent Russian oligarch has been released from house arrest and may even be granted a presidential audience.
Vladimir Yevtushenkov's arrest on charges of alleged money laundering a few months ago sent shivers through Russia's business elite, who feared it might be a harbinger of more to come.
The threat from without: Bear-baiting
As usual, Mr Putin appeared to extend some olive branches, claiming he wanted to work with the West on issues of mutual concern, and insisting Russia stood ready to mediate in the Ukraine crisis.
But elsewhere there was no spirit of compromise or conciliation, or any sign of the radical change in Russia's outlook which the EU foreign policy chief has just appealed for.
On Ukraine: ""We are right and you are wrong,"" he said, accusing the West of backing an illegal coup and explaining away the conflict in the south-east as Kiev's ""punitive"" onslaught on its own citizens.
President Putin says the West is once again trying to rein in the Russian bear
And Russia's involvement? Yes, there were some volunteer soldiers, but they were ""not mercenaries - they aren't being paid"". Also, any trucks contained humanitarian aid.
More importantly, in the last two months Mr Putin and his top officials have begun to argue that this crisis is not really about Crimea and Ukraine at all. Really, he now says, this is an age-old campaign by hostile Western powers intent on weakening and containing a Russian foe.
Any new ""walls"" being erected in Europe are due to Nato's expansion, not Russian aggression. The West, he claims, has always wanted to ""chain the bear"" and ""defang it and pull out its claws"".
He even insinuated that Russia's war with Chechnya in the 1990s may have been partly fuelled - on the Chechen side - by outside help from the West.
The threat from within: Invisible traitors
As for Russia's internal politics, he was twice asked where he drew the line between  a ""fifth column"" of traitors whom he says he will not tolerate, and a legitimate political opposition.
Mr Putin repeatedly said it was a delicate matter and a difficult line to draw - hardly reassuring for those worried about where they stand.
He added that it came down to what his critics thought. Were they Russian patriots who held their country dear, or were they acting on the orders of another government whose interests were alien to Russia's?
He doesn't know what he earns
The Kremlin is well-defended, says Mr Putin
Some of the Russian questions were surprisingly sharp and challenging:
Was the economic pain Russia was enduring now the cost it had to bear for taking Crimea?
Did Mr Putin know that some in his entourage privately blamed him for Russia's problems, so was he afraid of a palace coup? The answer: ""No, because we have no palaces and the Kremlin is well defended.""
And was it not his own cronies, those who reaped high salaries from controlling state enterprises or the main TV channels who were really the enemies of Russia?
Mr Putin calmly replied that Igor Sechin, who runs Russia's biggest state oil company, was an efficient manager and he had no idea what he earned. As an afterthought the Russian President added that he did not know what his own salary was either.
As usual at this annual extravanganza, many regional journalists waved placards, like peasants petitioning their tsar. One woman, from a car magazine, brought along a green woolly crocodile to make her point.
Another man, with slurred speech, called for Russians to drink less foreign Coca-Cola and more domestic kvas, a Russian honey drink. Mr Putin agreed with him, and joked that the questioner had already had enough - though it later emerged he was not drunk but had suffered from a stroke.
Putin and love
Probably the Russian public will best remember the woman from Voronezh who said her aunt wanted to know if he, Russia's top bachelor, was still single. Mr Putin's reply: ""Say hi to your aunt and tell her all is well.""
He added that he had told another friend that he was no monster but loved someone and was loved in return - and maintained good relations with his ex-wife.
Mr Putin knows how to please the crowds. He throws in a few personal details to signal that he is as human as anyone else, and - even at this time of crisis - he is relaxed enough to enjoy banter with the audience in between the reassurances that Russia will weather its difficulties.

"55","Luxembourg speaks for the Dutch","How Luxembourg came to represent the Dutch","Luxembourg speaks for the Dutch
By Laurence Peter BBC News
Xavier Bettel says he is now satisfied that Luxembourg is not being unfairly targeted over tax
Juncker denies tax break allegations
It's not often that a country of half a million gets to represent a nation of 16 million.
Luxembourg Prime Minister Xavier Bettel pointed that out light-heartedly, as he stood in for the Netherlands at an EU summit in Brussels.
His Dutch counterpart Mark Rutte is embroiled in a coalition dispute over healthcare legislation.
So Mr Bettel came here not long after Mr Rutte had phoned him to make the request.
It is all the more surprising because Luxembourg is in the EU spotlight over its controversial tax sweeteners for huge corporations like Amazon and Microsoft.
Why was Luxembourg chosen, rather than Belgium, to represent the Netherlands?
""Because I'm older [than the Belgian PM] and I've been in the European Council longer,"" Mr Bettel told journalists.
""For me it's a question of trust - you know how closely in the Benelux we work together.""
Dutch PM Mark Rutte faces trouble at home over healthcare reform
Inevitably the hot topic of tax arrangements came up.
He said Luxembourg had dropped its appeals to the European Court of Justice over a European Commission request for information on Luxembourg tax rulings and the Grand Duchy's patent box scheme, which deals with intellectual property taxes.
The Commission had initiated an infringement procedure against Luxembourg.
But Mr Bettel said he was now satisfied that Luxembourg was not being singled out, because soon all 28 EU states would have to divulge tax information to the Commission.
""We always said fishing [for information] was not the right way to work - we insisted on a level playing field, so the rules are the same for everyone.""
So Luxembourg defused the court dispute. But tax competition in the EU is still a big source of tension.
After the financial crisis, the time has come to investigate Europe's tax havens, where for years companies and individuals avoided paying - albeit legally - billions in taxes.

Lakhvi's bail in 26/11 case unacceptable: India
RELATED
Don’t compromise with terrorists, India tells Pakistan
NEW DELHI: A day after a Rawalpindi anti-terrorism court granted bail to Zakiur Rehman Lakhvi, the key handler in the 26/11 Mumbai attacks case, India has conveyed its strong concerns and sentiments of people to Pakistan through diplomatic channels, MEA spokesman Syed Akbaruddin said.
The release of Lakhvi will make a mockery of Pakistan's commitment to fight terror groups without hesitation and without making distinctions, India has told Pakistan.
""Despite repeated assurances that have been received, we have seen both the prosecution of the seven accused in the anti-terror court in Islamabad, as also the investigation by the authorities into the larger conspiracy surrounding the Mumbai attack case, proceeding at a glacial pace.
""The story of repeated postponements, adjournments and unavailability of concerned law officers or witnesses is well documented and does not require repetition. The move to grant bail to Zakiur Rahman Lakhvi yesterday has taken this saga to another level,"" official spokesman in the external affairs ministry Syed Akbaruddin said.
""We have, therefore, forthwith communicated to Pakistan through diplomatic channels our strong concerns on this matter and the sentiments across the spectrum of Indian society that that this will make a mockery of Pakistan's commitment to fight terror groups without hesitation and without making distinctions,"" the spokesman said.
'Pak will continue to export terror'
Lakhvi's bail came a day after India expressed full solidarity with Pakistan in the aftermath of the Peshawar massacre, and the court order led New Delhi to react strongly against the bail. The court said the charge-sheet against Lakhvi and other accused was flawed and lacking in evidence. The prosecutor did not say whether the government would appeal in a higher court against the court's bail order.
Sources said the Federal Investigation Agency, which had provided solid evidence to the court about LeT's involvement in the Mumbai attacks, disagreed with the bail but had to accept anti-terrorism court judge Kausar Abbas Zaidi's order.
The court directed Lakhvi, a trusted lieutenant of Jamaat-ud-Dawa chief Hafiz Saeed, to pay surety bonds worth Rs 5,00,000 ($5,000) before his release. Advocate Rizwan Abbasi had filed the bail application of the seven accused a day earlier, when lawyers across the country were on strike over the school carnage.
""We were not expecting this decision as we were still to produce a good number of witnesses in the case. We are awaiting the court's detailed order before giving further comment on the decision,"" said chief prosecutor Chaudhry Azhar. Lakhvi's counsel Raja Rizwan Abbasi told agencies that the court had granted bail as ""evidence against Lakhvi was deficient"".
After Lakhvi's release on bail, we should stop pleading with Pak and follow policy of Israel in ensuring retribution to terrorists.

Three detained in Jabalpur for following Mehdi's twitter handle

BHOPAL: Madhya Pradesh counter-terrorist group and anti-terrorist squad detained three youths, who followed and interacted with ISIS propaganda on twitter account @ShamiWitness run by Mehdi Masroor Biswas.
The trio, picked up from Jabalpur district's Rampur Patel mohalla on Wednesday night, was among 17,700 followers of Mehdi's twitter handle, intelligence sources told TOI.
Though Jabalpur police is tight-lipped on detentions from the region, sources in the state's intelligence unit said suspects re-tweeted sensitive posts from the pro-ISIS account operated by Biswas, who was arrested by Bengaluru police last week on charges of waging war against India.
IP address of at least 50 'objectionable' emails on Biswas's id was tracked to computers in Jabalpur by Bengaluru police, who contacted their MP counterparts for investigations, sources said. More than 1 lakh replies to tweets by Biswas are being scanned. Police are also analysing whether any of these followers have anything to do with ISIS or any other jihadi outfits.
Twitter has also been asked to retrieve data connected to @ShamiWitness, including deleted messages and replies from its databank by police.
Jabalpur Inspector General (IG) Srinivas Rao and MPATS chief Sanjeev Shami denied making any arrests related to @ShamiWitness. ""Some other agency must be working on it, not us,"" said Shami citing 'detentions' could be a rumour. Insiders claim detainees are being questioned and will be released only after scanning contents of mail.

This was revealed in a Cobrapost investigation of politicians taking private jets, the information culled by Cobrapost through RTIs from airports under Airports Authority of India (AAI).
Prominent among frequent flyers are Congress president Sonia Gandhi, Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi, BJP president Rajnath Singh, BJP veteran LK Advani, NCP chief Sharad Pawar and former leader of opposition, now foreign minister Sushma Swaraj among others. State party politicians, former and sitting CMs, MPs and MLAs also featured in the list.
On January 23, 2013, EC had written to parties ""to submit... for scrutiny statement of election expenditures relating to each Lok Sabha state legislative assembly"". But EC papers Cobrapost availed show that Andhra CM and TDP president Chandrababu Naidu, BSP chief Mayawati and Trinamool general secretary Mukul Roy did not reveal complete travel expenses during campaigning, violating EC's rules. Naidu flew a Krishnapatnam Port craft with call sign VT-NAV thrice on April 21, 2014. Strangely, Navayuga Engineering also said Naidu flew in its aircraft with the same call sign VT-NAV on April 21 and 22, 2014. DGCA documents Cobrapost accessed however do not have VT-NAV on the list of 'non-scheduled operators permit holder'. This would imply VT-NAV is operating without DGCA permit. How had AAI allowed it to fly?
It was found that over 100 politicians had used private planes from a clutch of airports. For instance, former aviation minister Praful Patel has taken several flights out of Vadodara on craft run by various charter services and corporate houses.
Former Congress minister Veerappa Moily took a corporate charter plane from Mangalore to Delhi with wife on September 9, 2012. Moily was oil, power and corporate affairs minister in 2012. On December 7 and 8, 2012, then power minister Jyotiraditya Scindia flew a Jaypee Group chartered flight from Vadodara to a destination the company did not disclose to AAI. On December 8, Scindia went from Vadodara to Delhi in a Span Group nine-seater jet. It would have cost him about Rs 4 lakh.
Chief ministers often use planes owned by corporate houses. Madhya Pradesh CM, BJP's Shivraj Singh Chouhan on March 7, 2014 flew with six others from Jaipur to Bhopal on a Ligare Aviation Airking B-200; cost would be about Rs 4 lakh. He has also flown Business Jet India, SRC Aviation, Jaypee Group and Orbit Aviation craft.
Apart from this, Chouhan has reportedly also used state government craft for personal use. On December 31, 2011, he flew with wife and sons from Mangalore to Ojar in Maharashtra for a holiday. He also reportedly flew from Mangalore to Agati in Lakshadweep, it was found. Chhattisgarh CM Raman Singh availed a media company's planes at least thrice for personal use between June and August 2013.
Uttarakhand CM (2012 to 2014), Congress's Vijay Bahuguna extensively used corporate houses' charter flights. On January 23, 2014, he flew from Dehradun to Delhi with son, daughter-in-law and Congress leader Rajeev Shukla.
Bahuguna and his revenue minister Yashpal Arya and two others flew from Dehradun to GTC Helipad on June 14, 2013, the month a cloudburst triggered floods. They flew an Escorts Group plane, the conglomerate that deals in construction and material handling equipment.
Over September and October and in December 2013, the CM, his family flew between Dehradun and Delhi several times: taking Ligare Aviation and Air Charter Services flights. A Dehradun to Delhi charter costs about Rs 2.5lakh. Documents with Cobrapost show Bahuguna flew five more times in chartered craft, mostly owned by business houses.
Former corporate affairs minister Sachin Pilot flew with family Tirupati to Delhi on January 7, 2014 in a corporate house's charter. The flight would've cost Rs 6 lakh. BJD MP Pinaki Misra travelled with Triveni Earthmovers MD B Prabhakaran from Ranchi to Delhi on January 11, 2013, in an SRC Aviation plane. Misra responded to say that as an advocate he appears in various high courts. ""It's the client's responsibility to pay for my passage... apart from professional fees. All advocates use private chartered flights paid for by clients...""
From Registrar of Companies data it was learnt that charter companies who filed balance sheets revealed they were running huge losses. How then do these companies operate?

HYDERABAD: Chief minister Chandrababu Naidu on Thursday announced that after the capital city plans were furthered, his priority would shift to the transfer of Krishna waters to Pennar basin so that farmers of Rayalaseema would benefit.
Addressing TDP MLAs and MLCs on the Assembly premises, Naidu said this ambitious goal could only be achieved once the Polavaram project is completed. ""If Polavaram is completed, Godavari water could be trans ferred to the Krishna delta.
The water thus saved from Krishna could be transferred to Rayalaseema from the Srisailam project,"" Naidu said at the TDLP meeting on Thursday afternoon. ""The Polavaram project should not be seen as one which would only benefit the delta farmers. Rather, it will have a far reaching impact on the agricultural economy of the whole state. The chronic shortage of water for drinking and agricultural purposes in the Rayalaseema region could be addressed permanently once the Polavaram project gets commissioned. This is the next priority of the TDP government,"" said Naidu. The TDLP also discussed the issue of helping those BPL families who have not received any benefit from the government so far. With many members wanting the government to identify such families, Naidu assured them that he would do so and ensure the benefits reach them. Rajahmundry MLA Gorantla Buchchaiah Chowdary also suggested that special help should be extended to patients of AIDS, cancer, kidney problems etc.
DAY FOR GRIEVANCE REDRESSAL
Naidu on Thursday earmarked every Saturday as the day for MLAs and MLCs to meet him and get their issues about their constituencies and implementation of various schemes resolved. ""Starting from January 3, the chief minister will spare every Saturday for MLAs and MLCs. He will allot time to meet them throughout the day. The CM has also asked the ministers to ensure that they are in the capital as they might be needed when discussing the issues related to various constituencies,"" chief whip Kalava Srinivasulu told TOI.

Of?ces to shift, but Chandrababu Naidu to stay in Hyderabad

HYDERABAD/VIJAYWADA: AP chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu on Thursday said that though he would like to shift some of the state-level offices to Vijayawada by next June, he would continue to function from the ""political capital"" of Hyderabad for 10 years as stipulated in the AP Reorganisation Act-2014.
Addressing the Telugu Desam Legislature Party (TDLP) meeting in Hyderabad, he said that though there are hardly any facilities in the proposed capital region, government employees should be ready to work even from temporary accommodation. ""We would like to function from the proposed capital region after this academic year to give a sense of feeling to the people that the administration is around,"" he reportedly told his legislators.
Though Naidu has not unveiled a detailed plan for the shift yet, sources said at least 70 per cent of the state administration will function from Vijayawada and Guntur from June 2015.
Incidentally, the state-level committee appointed to look into the infrastructure in Vijayawada has not yet submitted its report to the government. Sources said the committee, comprising B Sambob, Ajay Kallam, and D Sambasiva Rao, did not even hold a meeting after its visit to Vijayawada in October. The panel had visited a few places, in cluding private engineering colleges on the outskirts of the city. In the meantime, the government posted Sambasiva Rao as the TTD executive officer.
Though Chandrababu Naidu had visited Medha IT towers near Gannavaram airport four months ago and found it fit for location of important offices, the state government has not de-notified the IT SEZ to enable utilization of the building for government offices. Similarly, the government did not focus on creation of basic facilities at Kevin Plaza near PWD grounds in Vijayawada.
Balaiah proposes NTR name for AP capital
Hindupur MLA and Tollywood actor Nandamuri Balakrishna on Thursday sprang a surprise by proposing the name of his father, late chief minister and TDP founder NT Rama Rao, for the new capital city of Andhra Pradesh. ""If that is not possible, at least one of the districts should be named after NTR,"" he said in the assembly lobby. Responding to this, information and public relations minister Palle Raghunatha Reddy said it would be possible to rename Hindupur as NTR district after the reorganization of the districts. ""There is a proposal to increase the number of districts in Andhra Pradesh. Anantapur may be divided into three districts. Since Hindupur is close to the NTR family, it would be apt to name it after NTR,"" the minister said.

Modi debuts on Forbes power list
BEIJING: Prime Minister Narendra Modi was placed No 2, behind Chinese President Xi Jinping, in a list of 30 top-performing world leaders by a Japanese market research firm.
German chancellor Angela Merkel was on the third place in the list that also measured the confidence of citizens in their leaders.
The survey of more than 26,000 respondents, conducted this fall by Tokyo-based GMO Research rated Xi, Modi, and Merkel the top-performing world leaders, with scores of 7.5, 7.3, and 7.2 respectively on a scale of one to 10.
The survey results were published by Harvard Kennedy School's Ash Centre for Democratic Governance and Innovation, and were analyzed by Anthony Saich, a China expert at the school.
The top three were followed by French President Francois Hollande (6.3), Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe (6.1), and Putin (6.0) at the bottom.
Obama (6.6) received middling marks, just ahead of British Prime Minister David Cameron (6.5).
In regards to the confidence citizens have in how their leaders handle domestic and international affairs, Xi topped the list in both categories at 94.8 per cent and 93.8 per cent respectively, with Modi slightly trailing behind with 93.2 per cent and 93.3 per cent respectively.
Russian President Putin came in third with 86.2% and 86%.
Elaborating on the high ratings Xi got, Saich said ""in countries where a single party dominates, or where public debate about political leaders is constrained, citizens typically rated their own officials much higher than did respondents in nations with a multi-party system and a more open and robust press.""
On Modi's performance in the list, Saich said: ""Two things did surprise me — how well Modi came out. I just put that down to the fact that he'd only just been elected and so I suspect that a lot of people didn't really know very much about him, and his own nationals were probably still in the phase of him having won the election.""
Other than these leaders, the survey also featured Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff and South African President Jacob Zuma.
The survey questioned people from 30 countries, including 12 from Asia, four each from Africa and the Americas, eight from Europe and two from Oceania — Australia and New Zealand.

SRINAGAR: Amidst rising incidents of crime in the Kashmir valley, a rape accused tried to resist arrest by throwing a hand grenade at a police party on Thursday in Bumhana in Kupwara district.
Mohammad Rasheed Bhat, Superintendent of Police (SP) Kupwara said an FIR had been lodged against Ghulam Qadir Dar, resident of Bumhama for rape.
""The Kupwara sessions court today asked the SHO Kupwara to execute the court order related to the case,"" Rasheed said. According to him, as soon as the police party reached the residence of Qadir, he threw a grenade at them injuring a constable. Ghulam Hassan, a policeman from Dragmulla post was rushed to hospital for treatment.
SP Rasheed said that the rape-accused, who was a former militant, tried to flee but failed to evade arrest.
In a separate incident, panic gripped Aungmatipora area of Anantnag district when the body of a ten year old boy was found in the fields. Police speculated the cause of death to be a head injury on the fourth standard student.
""It seems someone hit his head with a heavy stone,"" police said.
The deceased was identified as Abdul Rouf Naik, resident of Nagam in Kokarnag by Station House Officer Mattan in Anatnag.
""Rouf along with his family had arrived at Aungmatipora to inquire about the health of his aunt on Wednesday. He was last seen heading for a nearby field along with the local children. Family members along with locals searched for him and found his body,"" a police officer said, adding that an FIR has been registered and a probe initiated.
In a third incident, a man was arrested on the charge of cheating and rape on the pretext of marriage by Pampore police in Pulwama district.
SP Awantipora Tahir Saleem said that a woman, 21, had filed a complaint of sexual exploitation over a duration of three months. The accused was identified as Manzoor Ahmad Sofi alias Captain Kanwal, a resident of Mehand Srigaufara in Anantnag district. He claimed to be a major in the Indian Army.
""After three months, the victim came to know that the person is a cheat and a local contractor who is married with a nine year old daughter. The accused was arrested from Srigaufara Islamabad and has been sent to the central jail Srinagar,"" he said and added that medical report confirmed sexual abuse.

DIG, SPs shunted out after cops leave Gogoi alone at home

GUWAHATI: A DIG and two SPs of Assam Police were removed from duty on Thursday following a serious security lapse at chief minister Tarun Gogoi's official residence atop the Kainadhara Hills.
On Sunday night, Gogoi suddenly felt ill and didn't find anybody when he called for help. His family members were also out of town that night.
The home department, headed by Gogoi himself, started an inquiry immediately and prima facie found security lapses, a source said. Gogoi has a ZPlus security cover under which NSG commandos protect him only during his movements and at his office at the state secretariat. At home, a close protection team (CPT) and a house projection team (HPT) comprising personnel from the state police look after his security.
The Assam Police headquarters on Thursday afternoon removed DIG (security) KK Sarma and replaced him with DIG AJ Baruah. The two SPs — B Kalita and D Deka — have been replaced by additional SP (Sonitpur) NT Sawakare and additional SP (Cachar) Rajveer. Both these IPS officers are scheduled to be promoted to the rank of SP on January 1.
On Sunday, after hosting a lunch for his cabinet colleagues and party leaders to felicitate newly appointed Pradesh Congress Committee president Anjan Dutta, Gogoi retired to his official residence in the eastern corner of the city atop the highly fortified hill.
A source said that at 12.15 am, a sub-inspector made a last round and left the CM's residence after confirming that the CM had gone off to sleep without any health complaints. About 40 minutes later, at 12.50 am, the chief minister woke up feeling uneasy and started vomiting.
The source said the chief minister walked out of his bedroom into the adjacent office room and wanted to call the security personnel who were supposed to be posted just outside the door of the office room. However, he could not find anyone and picked up the intercom to call for help. Even the phone wasn't working, the source said.
Luckily, the security man who was missing from his post showed up and raised an alarm. One of the ASPs, Montu Thakuria, reached the CM's residence at 1.10 am followed by another ASP S Nath, 10 minutes later. The resident doctor was also by his side with medicines. The chief minister could not attend the first day of the winter session of the assembly as his doctors advised him rest.
The entire hill has just one resident, the chief minister, and it is the most secured place in the state with 15 posts all around the hill at different heights. Each post is manned by police personnel with light machine guns. In total, there are four companies of Assam Police battalion personnel, roughly about 120 of them, guarding the hill 24X7. Besides lower-rung personnel, the security team has two SPs, two additional SPs and a DSP with the DIG (security) at the top. All of them are armed with 9mm pistols for close range protection.
The source said none of the officers are detailed for any night stay at the CM's residence and the entire security is maintained by the CPT and HPT personnel. But the officer on night duty does make surprise visits to the residence every night. ""There is no designated place to rest inside the premises for officers. There is not even a chair to sit on,"" the source said.
He added that one of the SPs removed for the lapse was actually admitted to hospital that night after undergoing a hernia operation.

Despite doubts, Lok Sabha okays return of e-ricks to Delhi roads

NEW DELHI: Paving the way for existing e-rickshaws to return on Delhi roads, the Lok Sabha on Thursday passed two crucial amendments in the Central Motor Vehicle Act. These will bring the battery-operated vehicles under the act and fresh applicants can straightaway get learners' licence to drive such vehicles carrying four passengers.
The bill was passed amid several questions raised by some of the members about the passenger safety aspects of these vehicles and poor quality parts imported from China.
Though several opposition MPs claimed that the amendments were brought only because of the upcoming Delhi assembly election, road transport minister rejected the contention saying delaying the changes would harm over 2 lakh poor whose livelihood is dependent on these vehicles. He added no safety issue has been compromised.
Now, the bill will be introduced in the Rajya Sabha for passage where again there is little chance that it would be blocked by any political party. If even then a stalemate arises in the Upper House, the government can bring an ordinance since it has already been passed by Lok Sabha, sources said.
Gadkari said, ""This is an amendment bill. If we pass the bill, I will incorporate rules and regulations suggested by you,"" in response to members who demanded that the bill be sent to standing committee for a closer scrutiny. He added that early passage of the bill will be a boon for one crore underprivileged people who face a lot of health problems by plying cycle rickshaws manually.
Several members raised safety concerns and the danger posed by substandard vehicle parts from China. Congress MP Ranjeet Ranjan was more forthcoming when she said that she had her children rode an e-rickshaw. ""How many of us have travelled in an e-rickshaw. I took and so my children. But I decided never to use them....This vehicle can overturn if it hits a one feet stone or at a pothole. It's very risky,"" she said.
While welcoming the ""smart e-rickshaws"" TDP member Ram Mohan Naidu said though the amendments are being made keeping in mind the one lakh e-rickshaw owners, ""But we have to see that with the one lakh e-rickshaws, there will be at least four people traveling in that. We should also consider the safety of these four lakh people and the safety of the people who are on the roads, when they are put on the road. How much are we compromising on safety?""
He added the new licencing regime will make it easier for drivers but the key question is how much safety standards is being compromised. ""Holding a drivers licence is not just learning to drive the vehicle. They also know the rules of the road. That has to be taken care of,"" the young MP said.
Gadkari said while safety issues have been taken care of, at present there is no import of Chinese parts for these vehicles.

NEW DELHI: The insurance bill is unlikely to be passed in the current session of Parliament as efforts to end with suggestions that the Rajya Sabha stalemate can be broken by Prime Minister Narendra Modi making a brief statement on religious conversions failing to cut ice with the Government.
The view of some Opposition leaders that an intervention by the PM can facilitate a discussion on conversions was met with skepticism in government circles with BJP leaders wondering if such an understanding will be honoured by parties like Trinamool and CPM.
These Opposition leaders felt while home minister Rajnath Singh could reply to the debate, Modi's initial remarks can address the demand that he address the controversy over religious conversions organized by saffron groups.
BJP managers decided the Government could wait it out even if it meant the bill to hike FDI in insurance is not passed by Parliament in the current session. The government is working on fallback options including issuing an ordinance.
The government came close to achieving a breakthrough on Thursday when Congress leader Anand Sharma came close to initiating the stalled discussion on conversions. He was dissuaded from doing so by Trinamool MPs and the moment passed.
The Government agreed to Trinamool MP Derek O'Brien's notice in a move intended to outflank the Opposition. When O'Brien refused to begin, sticking the demand that the PM must address the House, the chair tossed the ball to Sharma.
The Government is understood to have pointed out that the PM's intervention on minister of state for food procession Niranjan Jyoti's abusive remarks against minorities did not lead to order being restored in the upper House.
Unsure whether the current heated confrontation with Trinamool in the backdrop of the CBI arrests in the Sarada case will allow the proper functioning of the Rajya Sabha, the government is looking to see if parties like NCP, Congress, SP and BSP are open to a middle ground.
Though the government has decided to continue waging a war of nerves with the Opposition, a series of ""Hindutva-related"" controversies have given non-NDA parties a common ground that has been missing since the Lok Sabha election.
The Sangh Parivar's ""anti-minority"" agenda and controversies like ""ghar vapasi"" have provided useful ammunition to parties like Trinamool to stall the government in the upper House where it lacks a majority.
While the PM has spoke in party meetings about the need for BJP MPs to avoid raking up issues other than those related to governance and development, he is understood to be reluctant to address the subject as a ""pre-condition"" to a discussion.

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: In a move that will substantially water down Kerala's liquor policy aiming at phased prohibition, the state cabinet on Thursday decided to allow 418 closed bars to start beer and wine parlours. The cabinet also decided that Sundays will no longer be dry days though working hours of bars will be reduced marginally.
Chief minister Oommen Chandy said the government has decided to bring in the amendments following the report submitted by the tourism and labour secretaries who studied the impact of the new policy in their respective sectors.
""It has been decided to bring down the working hours of bars from 15 hours a day to 12.30 hours. The timing of bars will be decided by the excise department based on this. The decision to lift dry days on Sundays has been taken following the report that the sale of liquor in Bevco outlets has increased by 60% on Saturdays. Apart from this the tourism industry was also severely affected by this decision,'' Chandy said.
The bars which were functioning till March 31 this year, and which meet basic hygiene requirements, will be eligible to start beer and wine parlours. This decision has been taken to help employees in these bars who became jobless after the government decision.
In the cabinet meeting, IUML leaders protested against the amendments, but Chandy sought to brush it away, saying, ""The IUML has always stood for total prohibition and they have difference of opinion with the UDF policy on this.""
When asked whether new beer and wine parlour licenses will be issued, the CM said, ""The UDF did not take any decision for not giving fresh licenses.'' The cabinet also decided to maintain status quo on club licences.
On shifting of Bevco outlets along the national and state highways as per the high court order, the cabinet decided to close down 10% of the outlets on January 1, 2015. ""There are 163 outlets along the national and state highways and it is not feasible to shift them. Hence it has been decided to close down these outlets in phases,"" Chandy said.
The cabinet also decided to continue with the 5% cess imposed on liquor which will be utilised for rehabilitation of bar employees.
The new amendments will be operational once orders are issued by the excise department. An expert committee will be constituted to study the impact of the new liquor policy in the state.

Bengal will lose Rs 8200cr after GST rollout: Finance minister Amit Mitra

KOLKATA: Bengal is going to lose Rs 4,000 crore at one go, on account of central sales tax (CST) only, if the draft Constitutional Amendment Bill on Goods and Services Tax (GST) is passed in Parliament in its present form without compensating the state with its pending CST share.
The Centre's move bypassing the Empowered Committee of the State Finance Ministers has come as a severe blow to the cash strapped Mamata Banerjee government that has to shoulder a huge debt burden left behind the Left Front government. According to state finance minister Amit Mitra, the aggregate revenue loss would be Rs 8,200 crore in the first year. The amount is almost 20% of the states own revenue generation of Rs 40,000 crore and 29% of the debt repayment of Rs 28,000 crore. The capital repayment out of this is Rs 9,000 crore which would be almost equal to revenue loss.
Alarmed at the haste of the Narendra Modi government that seems set to table the Bill in Parliament this session, state finance minister Amit Mitra has written to the chairman of the empowered committee of finance ministers A.R. Rather demanding an urgent discussion on the Constitution Amendment Bill.
GST is proposed as a destination based tax with tax revenues going to the consuming states. The states that consume more will be getting more tax, while producing states that export goods to other states will be apparently on the losing side. Producing states such as Bengal, Maharashtra have to tread with caution.
Alarmed at the haste of the Narendra Modi government that seems set to table the Bill in Parliament this session, the state finance minister has written to the chairman of the empowered committee A.R. Rather demanding an urgent discussion on the Constitution Amendment Bill.
Mitra took exception to the Centre's bid to push through the Bill without consulting the majority states when the Bill in its present form infringes upon the state's autonomy to tax certain items at its own rates and also keep certain items namely crude petroleum, diesel, aviation turbine fuel and natural gas outside the GST net.
The draft Bill includes petrol and petroleum products under the GST net when the Mamata Banerjee government had strongly objected against inclusion of these in the last meeting of the empowered committee meeting held on December 11. With most of the goods and services coming under the GST, the Bill also proposes to do away with the state's power to levy tax on select items — ""declared goods"" as provided under Article 286 of the Constitution.
What's more is the finance minister had urged to retain the state's higher tax rate on tobacco and tobacco products. Accordingly, a meeting of the empowered committee of the finance ministers was called on December 11 to discuss the amendments to the draft Bill submitted by the states. Later, Union finance minister Arun Jaitley was present in the meeting of the empowered committee. As many as 29 states supported Bengal's cause and the majority opposed the draft Bill in its present form, Mitra claimed.
The Union finance then told the committee to form a sub group for further discussion. Accordingly a sub group was formed with Gujarat, Punjab, Tamil Nadu and Karnataka without any representation from eastern states.
The sub-group discussed the Bill later without circulating it to the state finance ministers and the draft Bill got the Cabinet nod. ""I have written a letter to Arun Jaitley on December 15 pointing to this fact. He asked me to meet him. But the chairman of the empowered committee A R Rather, the finance minister of J&K, later told me that it will discussed in the committee before submission to cabinet. However, to our surprise we heard that it is tabled in the cabinet undermining the Empowered Committee and the federal structure,"" he added.
Elaborating the tax implications, Mitra pointed out that if the petrol and petroleum products is subsumed in GST then the state may loose up to Rs 2,350 crore. It may be noted that petroleum products and tobacco are considerable revenue earner to this debt ridden state.
This apart, sales tax on diesel in Bengal is 17% while that is on motor spirit (petrol) is 25%. There is a cess of Rs 1 as well on both diesel and MS along with some advalorem surcharges. The total revenue from of the state from this account is Rs 3,000 crore now. Besides, petrol and tobacco, the new draft of GST also proposed to subsume entry tax and CST is out of the divisible pool.
According to Mitra, in entry tax account the state would loose between Rs 1,200 crore and Rs 1,500 crore while in tobacco the loss will be Rs 350 crore. ""The major blow will be CST. Now the total due of the state on this account is Rs 78,000 crore and our due is Rs 4,500 crore from 2010. The centre is now offering only Rs 11,000 crore from this account to the states where we shall get only Rs 400 crore. The perpetual loss every year from this account would be Rs 2,600 crore which will be applicable from the second year of GST rolled out,"" the minister said. However, the Constitutional Bill has to be passed in Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha by a two-third majority.

NEW DELHI: To ease the parking woes of lawyers in the Supreme Court, the Centre has decided to allow advocates to park their vehicles in the adjacent parking lot managed by India Trade Promotion Organization (ITPO).
Solicitor general Ranjit Kumar, appearing for ministry for urban development, informed the Supreme Court that the government has decided to allow lawyers to park their cars in the parking area of ITPO.
He told a bench headed by Justice V Gopala Gowda that the ministry has also decided to create a ramp on the pavement of Bhagwan Das Road so that vehicles of TV channels including OB vans could be parked there. The SG said it could be done only after the SC security setup gave its clearance.
He also said that government has approved widening of the entry gate of Supreme Court so that two cars could enter simultaneously and prevent frequent jams witnessed every morning at the gate. This too would require clearance from SC security authority.

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Thursday asked the Karnataka High Court Chief Justice to set up a special bench to exclusively hear former Tamil Nadu chief minister J Jayalalithaa's appeal against conviction in a disproportionate assets case on day to day basis and decide it within three months.
A Bangalore trial court had convicted Jayalalithaa and three others - N Sasikalaa, J Elavarasi and V N Sudhakaran - on September 26 in the Rs 66.65-crore disproportionate assets case and sentenced them to various jail terms. This was challenged by her in the HC, which had refused bail to her while admitting her appeal.
The SC had granted bail to Jayalalithaa on October 17. On Thursday, a bench headed by Chief Justice H L Dattu extended her bail till April 18 and asked the Karnataka HC CJ to set up a special bench to expeditiously decide her appeal and not later than three months from the reopening of the HC.
When one of the complainants against her and BJP leader Subramanian Swamy complained that indirect tactics to threaten him continued, the bench said if he perceived any such threat, then he needed to just file an application for the apex court to take cognizance of the issue and pass appropriate orders.

SC seeks answers from Centre and Maharashtra on farmers suicide

RELATED
NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Thursday expressed serious concern over unabated suicide by farmers in drought-hit areas of Maharashtra and sought answers from the Centre and state government on a PIL which alleged that little had been done to ameliorate the woes of marginalized farmers.
A bench, headed by Chief Justice H L Dattu, said it was intending to take suo motu cognizance of the December 2 incident when a 75-year old farmer ended his life by lighting his own funeral pyre. ""We were distressed by the news item and were planning to take suo motu cognizance of it. But your PIL had already been filed,"" the bench told petitioner Rakesh U Upadhyay, an advocate.
The PIL claimed that as many as 3,146 farmers in Maharashtra have already committed suicide unable to bear the financial crisis caused by a grim drought situation in Vidharbha and Marathwada regions, where crops have failed repeatedly.
Upadhyay said on average four farmers were committing suicide every day and this year the total figure has so far reached 1,022. He said nothing had been done by the Centre and state government to solve the problem and no strategy is in place to provide immediately relief to the farmers.
""The small and marginal farmers are subjected to a vicious circle by private money lenders who take benefit of impractical governmental policies,"" the petitioner said requesting the court's intervention.
""The higher cost of Bt cotton seeds forced farmers to take loan from private money lenders who charge exorbitant interest rate of about 60% per year. These money lenders compel farmers to sell their cotton to them at a price much lesser than the market price,"" he said.
He said even when there was no drought and there was a good yield, the poor marginal farmers continued to suffer as the benefits of good crop was grabbed by the money lenders and middle men.

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Thursday directed the Centre to give an interim compensation of Rs 10 Lakh to the kin of Manipuri girl ThangjamManoramaDevi who was allegedly raped and killed by Assam Rifles jawans in 2004.
A bench headed by Justice T S Thakur passed the order while agreeing to hear Centre's appeal challenging Gauhati High Court order of 2010 in which the HC had directed the state government to open and act upon the probe report prepared by retired district judge C Upendra Singh on the facts and circumstances leading to her death.
On July 11, 2004, the bullet-riddled body of Manorama, then 32, was found at Laipharok Maring village in Imphal East. The previous night, personnel belonging to 17 Assam Rifles had picked her up from her residence at Bamon Kampu Mayai Leikai village in the same district after issuing an arrest memo.
Senior advocate Colin Gonsalves, appearing for Manorma's family, said the apex court has granted leave but refused to stay HC order and directed the Centre to pay interim compensation.

Venkaiah Naidu quips, use e-ricks, reduce pollution in Parliament!

READ MORE Venkaiah Naidu | parliament | e-rickshaws
RELATED
NEW DELHI: Amid light banter in the LokSabha on Thursday, Union minister VenkaiahNaidu suggested that battery-operated e-rickshaws should be allowed inside Parliament to help reduce pollution.
The issue came up for discussion during the debate on the Motor Vehicles (amendment) bill 2014. The bill was cleared by the Lower House. Interrupting transport minister Nitin Gadkari while he was responding to the bill, urban development minister Naidu said if e-rickshaws are allowed in Parliament House premises, he and leader of Congress in Lok Sabha Mallikarjun Kharge can travel together in the eco-friendly vehicle to attend House proceedings.
""Then, there will be no pollution in Parliament,"" he quipped.
Social Justice Minister Thawar Chand Gehlot joined in by saying Naidu can fit into these light vehicles but Kharge will have to reduce weight if he wants to travel with Naidu.
Gadkari, who was piloting the bill, referred to himself, saying four people like him could travel in e-rickshaw as he has lost 40 kg after a weight-reducing surgery done two years ago.
He said once when petrol prices rose substantially, Chandra Shekhar and others came to Parliament on bicycles. The transport minister, however, said he cannot allow plying e-rickshaws in certain places.

Lakhvi, Rawalpindi jail’s VVIP prisoner
Bharti Jain Bharti Jain,TNN | Dec 19, 2014, 04.09 AM IST
READ MORE Zaki-ur-Rehman Lakhvi | Rawalpindi’s Adiala jail
RELATED
NEW DELHI: LeT commander Zaki-ur-Rehman Lakhvi, who may be a free man soon, was no ordinary prisoner at Rawalpindi's Adiala jail. Not only did he enjoy the luxury of regular ""outings"" from prison to visit his family and friends, he was treated like a VVIP within the confines of the high-security prison and had a smooth traffic of visitors, most of them terror commanders seeking his guidance and advice.
Lakhvi, who had monitored the carnage from the LeT control room in Karachi and given blow-by-blow instructions to the 26/11 Mumbai attackers, was at one time using five different cellphones inside the jail to communicate with LeT commanders and cadres. According to intelligence sources, he made calls freely to keep tab on the outfit's operations and gave pep-talks to his terror associates.
According to a former Union home secretary, Lakhvi's detention in Adiala Jail is even better than a house arrest. While a person under house arrest cannot leave the premises of his detention or receive any visitors unless authorized by the detaining authority, Lakhvi was allowed to use vehicles and security to meet his family and terror associates outside the jail premises.
Lakhvi is known to have even fathered a child during incarceration, thanks to these ""outings"". Abu Jundal, the 26/11 handler who was deported to India in 2012, had told his interrogators here that Lakhvi, during one of their meetings in Adiala Jail, had informed him that the prison authorities had allowed his wife to visit him in prison in 2010 to perform conjugal rights, following which their son was born.
According to intelligence updates submitted to the government over a period of time, Lakhvi's ""cell"" in Adiala Jail is a well-appointed suite with all modern facilities, including a television set. He has access to newspapers and moves within the jail without any restrictions. ""He is kept in good humour by the jailors and prison staff, under what the security agencies believe are standing instructions from Pakistani state agencies like the ISI,"" a senior intelligence officer told TOI.
In fact, the jail authorities even arranged a birthday celebration for their most-coveted prisoner in 2012.
Agencies here believe that Lakhvi was arrested as Pakistan was under pressure from the Western nations. The arrest was meant to ""showcase"" Pakistan's commitment to bring 26/11 perpetrators to book, while secretly ensuring that he was not isolated from his family or his 'work' as a terror commander.
Pakistan has turned down repeated requests from Indian agencies for Lakhvi's voice samples, stating that its laws do not allow samples to be taken without the consent of the accused.

Sensex up 314 points in early trade on global trends
The author has posted comments on this article
PTI | Dec 19, 2014, 10.25AM IST
ApnaCircle
 Extending its rise for the second straight session, the benchmark BSE sensex spurted by over 314 points in early trade on Friday.
MUMBAI: Extending its rise for the second straight session, the benchmark BSE sensex spurted by over 314 points in early trade on Friday on firming global trend after the US Fed gave indication of holding interest rate hike in the short-term.
Besides, further recovery in the rupee, which was trading 11 paise higher at 63 against the dollar in early trade, also supported the rally.
The 30-share index, which had gained 416.44 points in the previous session, rose further by 314.29 points, or 1.16 per cent, to 27,440.86.
All the sectoral indices led by capital goods, realty, IT and metal were trading in positive zone with gains up to 1.87 per cent, rendering major support to the sensex and Nifty.
Also, the wide-based Nifty of the National Stock Exchange reclaimed the 8,200-mark by moving up 82.10 points, or 1.01 per cent, to 8,241.40.
Sustained buying by funds and retail investors, tracking a firming trend on global markets, after the Federal Reserve said on Wednesday a rate hike was unlikely in the short-term, mainly buoyed trading sentiment, brokers said.
Expectations of acceleration in reforms process after the Cabinet's clearance to the Constitutional Amendment Bill on GST too triggered buying activity, they said.
Among Asian markets, Hong Kong's Hang Seng was higher by 1.04 per cent, while Japan's Nikkei moved up by 1.92 per cent in early trade on Friday.
The US Dow Jones Industrial Average ended 2.43 per cent higher in Thursday's trade.

Village broadband plan bound to fail, says Trai chief

Trai chief Rahul Khullar
NEW DELHI: The government's ambitious national broadband plan to connect as many as 2.5 lakh villages through optic fibre came in for sharp criticism from telecom regulator Rahul Khullar , who termed the move as ""impossible"" to implement and something that is bound to ""fail"".
Khullar, the head of Telecom Regulatory Authority of India ( Trai ), also reiterated the need for higher spectrum availability before the February auctions and said efforts should be made to have four blocks of 3G spectrum (of 5MHz each) for sale instead of only one block that may be released by the Defence.
Speaking about the broadband expansion, he said that a plan to connect the entire country at one go is not the right way of providing broadband connectivity to all. ""We are deluding ourselves by saying that we will reach 100%. Isn't it simple to say that we will reach 50% first, or the metros, cities, and then the talukas? Why do we say 100% first, and then fail on it, and thereafter recriminate?"" Khullar said at a seminar 'India - Broadband For All' organised by Ericsson and COAI. ""It is an impossible target, (and) you are bound to fail"".
The Modi government plans to link village panchayats across the country by December 2016 through the national optical fibre network (NOFN). The idea is to provide broadband access to all through the programme, while promoting initiatives like e-governance, e-education and e-health.
Khullar said that a focus just on building optic fibre infrastructure ""is wrong"", but rather the government needs to focus on developing applications based on the requirements in the rural areas. He said that there is a need to engage state governments to work out local solutions and applications. ""Can you tell of any application that does this?""
Khullar said other stakeholders should also be roped in to make the project viable. ""Unless you can co-opt state governments, universities, hospitals, it will only be on paper. You can take it from me. It is not about (optic fibre) pipes, but about delivering outcomes.""

JSPL gets notice on charter licence
The author has posted comments on this article
Saurabh Sinha , TNN | Dec 19, 2014, 01.38AM IST
ApnaCircle
Naveen Jindal owned JSPL’s charter firm was given licence on December 23, 2008. 
NEW DELHI: The Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) has issued a notice to Naveen Jindal-owned Jindal Steel & Power's (JSPL) six-year-old non-schedule operator permit (NSOP) holder firm (read aircraft charter firm), asking it why its permit or charter licence should not be cancelled by allowing it to lapse when it comes up for renewal next week. The DGCA action comes after the home ministry withdrew the mandatory security clearance to Jindal's aircraft charter firm, said sources. No aviation company can operate without this clearance.
JSPL's charter firm was given licence on December 23, 2008. According to the DGCA website, it has a luxury 13-seater Global Express (VT-JSB) and a nine-seater Cessna 560XL (VT-JSS). The Global Express had come under DGCA scanner earlier this year during the general election campaign period when a number of charter aircraft were checked and some even grounded, including those of the Reliance and Adani Group.
This March, the Jindal Global Express was checked at Delhi airport and many lapses were reportedly found in it. This plane was checked along with Reliance's Falcon 9X — a high end luxury jet — that is used mainly by Kokilaben Ambani, Mukesh and Anil's mother. While the Reliance plane was grounded for a day, Jindal's Global Express escaped that punishment. If the firm's NSOP is cancelled, it may not take to the skies in a hurry.
A JSPL spokesperson said: ""JSPL has applied for the renewal in timely manner as provided by the law and has also followed it up in the regular course of business. We have just received a show-cause notice from DGCA on Tuesday, why our NSOP licence should not be withdrawn due to non-grant of security clearance. However, reasons for the non grant of security clearance have not been mentioned in the DGCA letter. Immediately, the next day, we replied to the show-cause notice asking DGCA, the detials of the reasons so that we can explain why NSOP licence deserves to be renewed. We are confident that there is no reason for the non renewal of NSOP. We await DGCA's response for our further necessary action and are also exploring our legal options.""

SpiceJet’s loss is other carriers’ gain

According to DGCA data, market shares of IndiGo and Jet shot up from October (when SpiceJet was flying its entire fleet) to November. Wadia Group’s GoAir also gained and carried more flyers.
NEW DELHI: SpiceJet's fall from grace has led the cash registers ringing for other Indian carriers. Troubles at Kalanithi Maran-owned low cost carrier (LCC) started from mid-November when leasers started repossessing aircraft, leading to reduction of flights. As SpiceJet's slashed its schedule, passengers of its cancelled flights made a beeline for other carriers — mainly IndiGo and Jet.
According to directorate general of civil aviation ( DGCA ) data, market shares of IndiGo and Jet shot up from October (when SpiceJet was flying its entire fleet) to November (see graph). Wadia Group's GoAir also gained and carried more flyers.
State-owned Air India, which is being kept alive by pumping in thousands of crores of tax-payers' money, could not capitalize on the situation. It actually saw its market share drop by two percentage points from October to November. AI (domestic) even pipped SpiceJet in terms of numbers of passengers being affected by flight cancellations. As many as 4,242 AI passengers had seen their flights cancelled, while the figure for SpiceJet was 3,290. And, 27,200 AI (domestic) flyers faced delays of over two hours. ""The focus may be on SpiceJet but AI should be the real worry for the government,"" said an official.
Meanwhile on Thursday, sources said SpiceJet operated over 140 flights by evening and had six cancellations by then — out of its truncated schedule of 230 daily flights. Oil companies have put SpiceJet on cash-and-carry and the LCC is paying cash to get fuel.
Full service carriers, Jet and AI, are now planning to fill in the void created by SpiceJet's flight reduction. They are both planning to deploy wide body aircraft on domestic routes. AI has three Boeing 777-200 (long range) which it will lease out by next summer. It plans to utilize these three twin aisle planes on domestic sector till then.
Jet on Thursday introduced 12 additional daily flights on domestic routes. It will deploy wide body Airbus A-330 on routes like Delhi-Bengaluru-Delhi and Delhi-Chennai-Delhi from next Tuesday to January 29, 2015.

Coal India to get new chairman ahead of key meeting: Sources

Coal India Ltd will get new chairman in next few days, two officials with direct knowledge of matter said, as miner readies plan to double its output.
NEW DELHI: Coal India Ltd will get a new chairman in the next few days, two officials with direct knowledge of the matter said, as the state-owned miner readies a plan to double its output in four years amid a severe shortage that has crippled power plants.
Career bureaucrat Sutirtha Bhattacharya, chairman of India's second-largest coal producer Singareni Collieries, will take over as the head of its bigger rival ahead of a key meeting at Coal India's headquarters on December 30, the officials said.
The world's largest coal miner by output has been without a full-time chairman since June. The appointment comes at a time when the Narendra Modi government is trying to sell a 10 per cent stake in the company and break its near-monopoly by allowing private firms to mine and sell coal.
The officials did not want to be named before an announcement, which may come as soon as this week, but said the meeting is to discuss a detailed plan to raise output to 1 billion tonnes.
Under Bhattacharya, Singareni, majority owned by the state of Telangana, has been able to easily beat its production targets, unlike Coal India that has not met its target for the past several years.
Disruptions by worker unions, a lack of adequate railway lines and less use of machines have dragged Coal India's output. Its unions have threatened to go on a five-day strike starting Jan. 6, opposing the divestment plan and opening up of the industry for the first time in 42 years.

RBI may cut rates early next year: C Rangarajan

C Rangarajan.
HYDERABAD: The Reserve Bank of India may go for rate cut early next year as price situation is showing 'definite improvement', former chairman of Prime Minister's economic advisory council, C Rangarajan said on Thursday.
He, however, cautioned that volatility in the currency markets should also be taken into consideration before going for any policy decision.
""The price situation is showing definite improvement. The latest policy statement has clearly given indication if the price behaviour is along the trajectory envisage ... I expect probably changes will come in the early part of next year. It could be any time.
""But the only factor that has to be taken into account at the present moment is the fact that there is great volatility in the foreign currency markets. And therefore, the timing will also be influenced by what is happening in the foreign exchange markets,"" Rangarajan told reporters when asked about the possible rate cut by the RBI.
Rangarajan was here to deliver the inaugural address during a seminar organized by the Institute for Development and Research in Banking Technology.
Replying to a query on falling oil prices, he said net oil importing countries such as India will benefit from the situation in terms of reducing current account deficit.
He predicted that if the situation continues, the CAD will be in the range of 1.7 per cent of the GDP as that of last year.
""Well, the initial expectation was because of the fall in oil prices, the CAD may be even lower than last year. But because of the pick-up of gold imports and all that I expect the CAD to be the same as the last year ... something like 1.75 per cent of the GDP,"" the former RBI governor said.
Earlier in his address, he said with over 500 million bank accounts in the country, it is estimated that the Indian banking system produces over one billion transactions a day.
He stressed on the importance of cyber security systems that are needed for banks to prevent the possible threats to the economy.

Rupee sees biggest gain in 7 months
The author has posted comments on this article

The partially convertible rupee ended at 63.11/12 per dollar versus its Wednesday's close of 63.6150/6250. 
MUMBAI: Markets rallied on Thursday, with the rupee posting its biggest single-day gain in seven months and rebounding from a 13-month low, after the US Federal Reserve said it would take a ""patient"" approach in deciding when to raise interest rates.
Reserve Bank of India governor Raghuram Rajan had called the prospect of US rate hikes a risk to emerging markets given expectations that overseas investors may pare their bets on higher-yielding debt of countries such as India.
Indian shares and bonds also benefited as Russia's rouble stabilised after dramatic falls this week, reducing some of the fears of financial contagion to emerging markets.
Bonds and the rupee were still headed for their worst week since August, when global markets were roiled by rising tensions in the Middle East and uncertainty about Fed rate hikes.
""The fact that rate hikes will still be data dependant and Fed will be patient is positive for the rupee,"" said Hari Chandramgethen, head of foreign exchange trading at South Indian Bank, who does not expect a Fed rate hike until June.
Traders said large dollar-selling by foreign banks on behalf of their overseas clients was a key reason helping the rupee and bonds during the session. The flows will remain a key factor in the near-term for markets.
The partially convertible rupee ended at 63.11/12 per dollar versus its Wednesday's close of 63.6150/6250. It had touched 63.89 in the previous session, its weakest level since Nov. 13, 2013.
On the day, the rupee gained 0.8%, its biggest single-day gain since a similar rise seen on May 16 when election results gave the Bharatiya Janata Party a full mandate.
Fed chairman Janet Yellen told a news conference that ""patient"" meant the US central bank was unlikely to hike rates for ""at least a couple of meetings,"" meaning April of next year at the earliest.
The benchmark 10-year bond yield ended down 4 basis points on the day at 7.93%. The yield rose to 8.03% on Wednesday, its highest level since Dec. 1.
In the overnight indexed swaps market, the benchmark 5-year swap rate dropped 6 basis points to 7.28%, while the 1-year rate fell 7 basis points to 7.85%.
Meanwhile, shares gained 1.6 % on hopes of tax reforms and underpinned by the global rally.

The domestic markets also followed a rally in global markets after the US Federal Reserve kept its monetary policy unchanged.
MUMBAI: The benchmark BSE Sensex surged by 416 points to close above 27,000 level while the wider Nifty reclaimed 8,100 mark on Thursday on value buying after recent sharp falls and hopes on tax reforms as the Cabinet cleared the long-pending GST bill.
The domestic markets also followed a rally in global markets after the US Federal Reserve kept its monetary policy unchanged.
The Cabinet approved the Constitution Amendment Bill on Goods and Services Tax (GST) which bolstered the market sentiments. The rupee rebounding from 13-month low also backed strong buying trend, brokers said.
The 30-share Sensex barometer regained the 27,000-level at the outset and surged to the day's high of 27,180.92 before ending at 27,126.57, a rise of 416.44 points, or 1.56%, its biggest single-session gain since October 31.
The gauge rallied by 519.50 points on October 31. The index had lost 1,120.97 points in the previous five sessions on weak economic data and rising trade deficit.
The 50-issue NSE Nifty reclaimed 8,100 level by rising 129.50 points, or 1.61%, to end at 8,159.30 after soaring to 8,174.30.
Strong gains of up to 4.91% in index scrips, led by BHEL, Hindalco and Gail helped the market rebound.
ICICI Bank, Maruti Suzuki, Cipla, NTPC, Tata Power, Axis Bank, L&T, Tata Steel, Bajaj Auto, Tata Motors and SBI were among major gainers.
Overall, 27 counters gained in the 30-scrip index. Laggards included M&M, Dr Reddy and Hind Unilever.
The Small-cap and Mid-cap indices too joined the rally. The BSE Midcap index recovered 2.66% and Smallcap index rose 3.28%.
The rupee recovered from 13-month low and was trading 44 paise higher at 63.17 (intra-session) against the dollar at the forex market on Thursday.

Gold falls by Rs 50 on sluggish demand

Gold prices fell by Rs 50 to Rs 27,250 per ten gram at the bullion market in the national capital on Thursday owing to slackened demand from jewellers even as gold rose in global market.
NEW DELHI: Gold prices fell by Rs 50 to Rs 27,250 per ten gram at the bullion market in the national capital on Thursday owing to slackened demand from jewellers even as gold rose in global market.
However, silver ready held steady at Rs 36,700 per kg. Traders said fall in demand from jewellers and retailers at prevailing levels mainly led to the fall in gold prices but a better trend overseas after the US Fed kept its momentary policy unchanged, limited the losses.
Gold in Singapore advanced as much as 1 per cent to $1,202.08 an ounce.
In Delhi, gold of 99.9 and 99.5 per cent purity declined by Rs 50 each to Rs 27,250 and Rs 27,050 per ten gram respectively. It had gained Rs 100 on Wednesday.
Sovereign, however, remained steady at Rs 23,700 per piece of eight gram in limited deals.
On the other hand, silver ready ruled steady at Rs 36,700 per kg but weekly-based delivery inched up by Rs 25 to Rs 36,800 per kg on speculators' buying.
Meanwhile, silver coins continued to be traded at last level of Rs 61,000 for buying and Rs 62,000 for selling of 100 pieces.

Government on Thursday said it is promoting use of organic fertilizers and studies have shown that farm yields have not fallen where use of chemical fertilizers was restricted.
NEW DELHI: Government on Thursday said it is promoting use of organic fertilizers and studies have shown that farm yields have not fallen where use of chemical fertilizers was restricted.
Rural development minister Birender Singh told Lok Sabha a scheme to empower woman farmers has made positive impact as it supplements their income and use of manures like cow dung is encouraged under the scheme.
""Yields have not gone down. It has come up... where chemical fertilizers were not used,"" he said during Question Hour.
Singh said government has identified over 10 crore houses where women were involved in farming and eight crore such households could be covered by Mahila Kisan Sashaktikaran Pariyojna (Woman Farmers Empowerment Scheme). Three crore of them are ""ultra poor"", he said.
Government has so far approved 56 such projects, he said. Singh also said government would supply drinking water across the country by 2022 and 90 per cent households would be covered by piped water.
Currently, he said, there are 11 drinking water projects being implemented across the country with the help of foreign aid.

SBI approves OTS for mining-affected borrowers
The author has posted comments on this article
PTI | Dec 18, 2014, 02.07PM IST
ApnaCircle
State Bank of India has approved the one-time settlement (OTS) scheme for its borrowers from the beleaguered mining industry in Goa.
PANAJI: State Bank of India has approved the one-time settlement (OTS) scheme for its borrowers from the beleaguered mining industry in Goa.
This is expected to pave way for other financial institutions to settle the long-pending bad debt of those who are in a lurch due to the halting of mining in the state.
The scrutiny committee of the state's Economic Development Corporation (EDC) yesterday recommended the Goa government to go ahead with the OTS offered by SBI to its borrowers, a senior EDC official said.
The bank has proposed 30 per cent waiver on principle loan amount to the truck owners and 40 per cent to the barge owners, he said.
The bank has also offered to waive 100 per cent interest on the loans procured by the truck and barge owners from September 30, 2012, when iron ore exports had stopped following the Supreme Court order vis-a-vis illegal mining in the state, he said.
The truck, barge and mining machinery owners reeling under the debt were earlier offered subsidy up to 35 per cent on their loan amount by the Goa government.
The government had asked the banks to provide relief through OTS as assets of these borrowers had turned into NPA.
The loans of 8,000 trucks, barges and machinery owners are feared to turn into bad debt, and the state government has estimated the total loan exposure of the mining dependent people to be about Rs 1,000 crore.
The other lenders like Lokmanya Cooperative Society, Syndicate Bank, Bank of India, IndusInd Bank and Canara Bank have also submitted their OTS, which would be vetted by the scrutiny committee before recommending the government to go ahead with it, the official added.

SBI approves OTS for mining-affected borrowers

State Bank of India has approved the one-time settlement (OTS) scheme for its borrowers from the beleaguered mining industry in Goa.
PANAJI: State Bank of India has approved the one-time settlement (OTS) scheme for its borrowers from the beleaguered mining industry in Goa.
This is expected to pave way for other financial institutions to settle the long-pending bad debt of those who are in a lurch due to the halting of mining in the state.
The scrutiny committee of the state's Economic Development Corporation (EDC) yesterday recommended the Goa government to go ahead with the OTS offered by SBI to its borrowers, a senior EDC official said.
The bank has proposed 30 per cent waiver on principle loan amount to the truck owners and 40 per cent to the barge owners, he said.
The bank has also offered to waive 100 per cent interest on the loans procured by the truck and barge owners from September 30, 2012, when iron ore exports had stopped following the Supreme Court order vis-a-vis illegal mining in the state, he said.
The truck, barge and mining machinery owners reeling under the debt were earlier offered subsidy up to 35 per cent on their loan amount by the Goa government.
The government had asked the banks to provide relief through OTS as assets of these borrowers had turned into NPA.
The loans of 8,000 trucks, barges and machinery owners are feared to turn into bad debt, and the state government has estimated the total loan exposure of the mining dependent people to be about Rs 1,000 crore.
The other lenders like Lokmanya Cooperative Society, Syndicate Bank, Bank of India, IndusInd Bank and Canara Bank have also submitted their OTS, which would be vetted by the scrutiny committee before recommending the government to go ahead with it, the official added.

US Secret Service too insular, needs outside leader, more agents: Review
Reuters | Dec 19, 2014, 11.11 AM IST
US Secret Service agents. (Reuters photo)
RELATED
WASHINGTON: The US Secret Service needs an outsider to overhaul the insular agency, beef up staffing and improve training — after building a higher fence around the White House, an independent review concluded on Thursday.
An executive summary of the highly classified review revealed deep problems at the top of the Secret Service, which is charged with guarding the US president and other senior government officials.
""The panel heard one common critique from those inside and outside the Service: The Service is too insular,"" the published summary said.
Homeland security secretary Jeh Johnson appointed a four-member independent panel in October after a Sept. 19 intrusion by an Iraq war veteran who scaled the White House fence, sprinted across the lawn and got deep inside the mansion before an off-duty agent stopped him.
That incident prompted the panel's first recommendation: build a better fence ""as soon as possible."" It recommended one that is at least 4 or 5 feet (120 or 150cm) higher and curves outward at the top to give agents more time to assess the risk of a jumper.
But the agency's problems, it noted, ""go deeper than a new fence can fix.""
A director not tied to agency traditions and personal relationships will be better equipped to do an honest reassessment and encourage a culture of accountability.
The last Secret Service director, Julia Pierson, was a 30-year veteran who was tasked with cleaning up the agency's culture after a 2012 presidential trip to Colombia in which up to a dozen agents were found to have hired prostitutes.
Pierson resigned under fierce criticism on Oct 1, less than two weeks after the Sept. 19 White House intrusion. That fence jumper breach came a day after the disclosure that an armed private security contractor rode on an elevator with Obama in Atlanta in a breach of protocol earlier in September.
The security lapses, along with a 2011 incident in which seven gunshots were fired at the White House, had raised concerns across Washington that Obama was not as well protected as he should be in an age of global tumult.
The panel said special agents and uniformed division personnel work an ""unsustainable number of hours.""
""The Secret Service is stretched to and, in many cases, beyond its limits,"" the panel said. It recommended adding at least 85 special agents and 200 uniformed officers so the agency can shorten long shifts, reduce overtime and free up agents for regular training.
The agency's training regimen is far below acceptable levels, it said, with the average special agent receiving only 42 hours of training.
""The panel's recommendations are astute, thorough and fair,"" Johnson said in a statement.
Republican Representative Jason Chaffetz, incoming chairman of the Oversight and Government Reform Committee, on Thursday promised an independent congressional review of the agency.
The panel acknowledged that many of its recommendations had been made before but never implemented.

Israel won't accept 'unilateral' Palestine bid: Netanyahu

Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. (Reuters photo)
RELATED
JERUSALEM: Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Friday Israel would never accept the ""unilateral"" recognition of a Palestinian state, after a draft resolution calling for a final peace deal was submitted to the UN.
In a statement from his office, Netanyahu accused Palestinian president Mahmud Abbas of ""thinking he can threaten us by taking unilateral steps"" over statehood.
""He doesn't understand that his authority in the West Bank will be overturned by Hamas like it was in Gaza,"" the Israeli premier added.
""We will never accept unilateral diktats,"" Netanyahu said.
The Palestinian draft resolution, submitted yesterday to the UN in New York, sets a 12-month deadline for wrapping up negotiations on a final settlement and the end of 2017 as the timeframe for completing an Israeli withdrawal from Palestinian territories.
A final peace deal would pave the way to the creation of a Palestinian state with Jerusalem as a shared capital, according to the text.
Israeli foreign minister Avigdor Leiberman also played down the chances of the Palestinians' UN bid achieving a breakthrough.
""Without Israel's agreement nothing will change,"" he said in a statement.
""The UN Security Council would do better to deal with the issues truly important to the safety and security of the citizens of the world... and not waste time on Palestinian gimmicks,"" Leiberman said.

Crucial spy in Cuba paid a heavy Cold War price

WASHINGTON: He was, in many ways, a perfect spy — a man so important to Cuba's intelligence apparatus that the information he gave to the Central Intelligence Agency paid dividends long after Cuban authorities arrested him and threw him in prison for nearly two decades.
Rolando Sarraff Trujillo has now been released from prison and flown out of Cuba as part of the swap for three Cuban spies imprisoned in the United States that President Obama announced Wednesday.
Mr Obama did not give Mr Sarraff's name, but several current and former American officials identified him and discussed some of the information he gave to the CIA while burrowed deep inside Cuba's Directorate of Intelligence.
Mr Sarraff's story is a chapter in a spy vs. spy drama between the United States and Cuba that played on long after the end of the Cold War and years after Cuba ceased to be a serious threat to the United States. The story — at this point — remains just a sketchy outline, with Mr Sarraff hidden from public view and his work for the CIA still classified.
The spy games between the two countries lost their urgency after the fall of the Soviet Union, but the spies have stuck to their roles for more than two decades: pilfering documents, breaking codes and enticing government officials to betray their countries. ""There were a number of people in the Cuban government who were valuable to the U.S., just as there were a number of people in the U.S. government who were helpful to the Cubans,"" said Jerry Komisar, who ran C.I.A. clandestine operations in Cuba during the 1990s.
With Wednesday's exchange of imprisoned spies and the leaders of the United States and Cuba talking in a substantive way for the first time in more than 50 years, some people who were part of the spy games between the two countries now wonder just how much it was worth it.
In retrospect, Mr Komisar said, there was little need for American intelligence services to devote so much attention to Cuba — a country with a decrepit military that he said posed no strategic threat to the United States since the Soviet Union pulled its missiles off the island in 1962.
After decades of cloak-and-dagger activities between the two countries, he said, it turned out to be ""a draw.""
""You have to ask yourself, 'To what end?' "" he said.
Before he was arrested in November 1995, Mr Sarraff worked in the cryptology section of Cuba's Directorate of Intelligence and was an expert on the codes used by Cuban spies in the United States to communicate with Havana. According to members of his family, he had studied journalism at the University of Havana and had the rank of first lieutenant at the intelligence directorate.
It is not clear when Mr Sarraff, now 51, began working for the CIA Chris Simmons, who was the chief of a Cuban counterintelligence unit for the Defense Intelligence Agency from 1996 to 2004, said that he worked with another man — Jose Cohen, one of Mr Sarraff's childhood friends — to pass encryption information to the C.I.A. that led to the arrest of a number of Cuban agents operating in the United States.
Mr Simmons said that Cuba's spy service regularly communicated with its agents in America using encrypted messages sent over shortwave radio. After Mr Sarraff helped the United States crack the codes, he said, the FBI was able to arrest Cuban spies years after Mr Sarraff was discovered and put in prison in Cuba.
""When Roly was providing information, he was giving us insights about where there were weaknesses in the Cuban encryption system,"" Mr Simmons said.
Cuban authorities arrested Mr Sarraff in November 1995 and put him on trial for espionage, revealing state secrets and other acts against state security. According to one senior American official, the Cuban government learned of his plans to defect when he was on assignment in a third country and recalled him to Cuba and put him in jail.
According to members of Mr Sarraff's family, he went to work one day in 1995 and never came home. Cuban officials told the family for more than a week that Mr Sarraff was on a job in the country's interior and would be back soon.
He was sentenced to 25 years in prison. Mr Simmons, the former D.I.A. officer, said he believed that the reason Mr Sarraff was not executed was because his parents were officials in the Cuban government. ""He has always maintained his innocence"" his sister, Vilma Sarraff, said by telephone from Spain. She said that Mr Sarraff's daughter was 7 when he was arrested.
Mr Cohen escaped Cuba on a raft and was sentenced to death in absentia. He now lives in Miami and works as an Amway salesman. In an interview on Thursday, he insisted that neither he nor Mr Sarraff ever sold information. ""What I did I did because I admired the values of this country, and because what was happening in Cuba was a farce,"" he said.
Mr Cohen declined to offer any details about the espionage, saying it was too dangerous to discuss the case without direct proof that Mr Sarraff had left Cuba. He said that the Cuban government never had any hard evidence to present against Mr Sarraff and said his friend's case was politically motivated.
""They sentenced me to death and then sentenced him to 25 years to serve as a lesson for everybody else,"" he said.
In his speech Wednesday, Mr Obama referred to Mr Sarraff as ""one of the most important intelligence agents that the United States has ever had in Cuba,"" someone who ""provided America with the information that allowed us to arrest the network of Cuban agents that included the men transferred to Cuba today, as well as other spies in the United States.""
Hours later, the office of the Director of National Intelligence issued a statement saying the information from Mr Sarraff — the statement did not name him — had helped the government arrest and convict several Cuban spies inside the United States. The convictions included a senior analyst at the Defense Intelligence Agency named Ana Belen Montes; a former Department of State official, Walter Kendall Myers, and his wife, Gwendolyn Myers; and members of the Red Avispa network, or Wasp Network, in Florida.
Multiple news accounts in recent years have identified Mr Sarraff as a former Cuban intelligence officer who had been imprisoned. The accounts named him as a possible candidate to be released if the United States and Cuba were ever to agree to a spy swap.
Some people here said this Trujillo is a ""patriot""? No, patriots are people who fight (or ""spy"") for their countries not for the enemy. The...
I am shocked that we would reward Cuba with an embassy when they treat their prisoners so horrifically. On the other hand we can...
What is the next trade? Tsarnaev for Snowden? This dangerous stuff trading criminals for criminals.
But Ms. Sarraff said that if her brother had in fact collaborated with American intelligence agencies to help snare Cuban agents living in the United States, it was certainly not something he ever discussed with his family.
""If what they are saying is true, fine, he paid that debt with 20 years in prison,"" she said.
Ms. Sarraff said her brother was in solitary confinement for 18 years. An avid painter and poet, he was not permitted any painting supplies or other distractions. He was also denied parole, Ms. Sarraff said.
She said that her brother had been calling his family regularly from prison, but that they had not heard from him in several days. She said her family had been told Mr Sarraff had been released from prison, but had not heard directly that he was part of a prisoner exchange.
She said she had no idea where he was.
""They did not say where they had taken him,"" she said, becoming irate.
""How is it possible that they take my brother out of the country without telling his parents? My parents are at the point where my father is likely to have a heart attack!""
Speaking by phone from Havana, Mr Sarraff's father, also named Rolando, said ""this is not a moment of happiness — it's panic.""
""I have gone three days without knowing the whereabouts of my son,"" he said. He confirmed that his son had once worked for Cuba's intelligence service.
As Mr Sarraff's family and friends wait to hear from him, his former partner in espionage said Mr Sarraff gave up his freedom for a cause he believed in.
""Here's what I can tell you about Roly: He is a person who loves liberty. He was jailed unjustly,"" Mr Cohen said.
""He sacrificed his life. When he gets here, he will tell his story.""

Boston suspect makes rare court appearance

RELATED
BOSTON: Shaggy-haired, bearded and attentive, accused Boston Marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev made his first public appearance in 17 months on Thursday, at a brief court hearing before his trial next month.
Tension was high at the US federal court in the northeastern city where the April 15, 2013 attack killed three people and wounded 264 — the worst such incident in the United States since 9/11.
A woman yelled out support for Tsarnaev in Russian at the end of the hearing. On the way into court, one of the victims angrily showed his artificial leg to demonstrators proclaiming the suspect's innocence.
Dressed in a black sweater and gray pants, a skinny 21-year-old Tsarnaev with unruly curls sat between two female lawyers in the packed court room to hear preparations for his January 5 trial.
He answered questions from Judge George O'Toole calmly and quietly in the brief session that lasted less than half an hour.
""Very much so,"" he said when asked if he was satisfied with his representation.
Tsarnaev is accused of carrying out the attacks with his brother, Tamerlan, who was killed in a shootout with police, and faces the death penalty.
He pleads not guilty to 30 charges. The attacks plunged Boston's world-famous marathon into mourning and revived fears of terrorism in the United States more than a decade after the al-Qaida hijackings.
Thursday's hearing was the first time he has been seen in public since entering his not guilty plea in July 2013.
At the time he was suffering from injuries from his time on the run. On Thursday he seemed in good health.
At the end, Elena Teyer, whose son-in-law Ibragim Todashev was shot dead by an FBI agent while being questioned in May 2013 about his friendship with Tamerlan, cried out in Russian.
""You have a lot of supporters. We all pray for you, we all know you're innocent,"" she said. ""Stop killing innocent people!"" she added in English before being forced out.
Families of the victims, with drawn faces, were separated from the rest of the public in the gallery.
Marc Fucarile, who lost a leg in the attacks, walked into court with the help of a cane.
""That's trickery?"" he demanded, showing his artificial leg to two demonstrators who held up placards questioning the FBI investigation.
The charges against Tsarnaev include conspiracy to use a weapon of mass destruction resulting in death and bombing a public place resulting in death.
He and Tamerlan are accused of planting two pressure cooker bombs hidden in backpacks near the finish line of the marathon.
He is also charged in connection with the shooting death of a campus police officer at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology during the brothers' wild overnight getaway attempt.
Initially scheduled for November 3, his trial is now due to begin on January 5 with jury selection, which could take several weeks.
The trial itself could take two to three months.
Tsarnaev is being held at Fort Devens prison hospital, home to 1,095 prisoners, around 44 miles (70 kilometers) from the Boston court.
His lawyers say he is held largely in isolation and subject to tight restrictions imposed by attorney general Eric Holder in August 2013.
A Muslim of part-Chechen descent, Tsarnaev emigrated with his family to the United States in 2002 and became a naturalized American citizen in 2012.
He allegedly scrawled a rambling explanation of his motives for the Boston attacks on an interior wall of the boat, where he was arrested in a suburban backyard several days after the attacks.
""The US government is killing our innocent civilians,"" Tsarnaev wrote. ""I can't stand to see such evil go unpunished ... we Muslims are one body, you hurt one you hurt us all.
""Now, I don't like killing innocent people, it is forbidden in Islam, but ... stop killing our innocent people and we will stop.""
He moved to Boston from Dagestan with his family at the age of eight and is said to be profoundly affected by his background and early childhood in Kyrgyzstan.
Prosecutors say the brothers, who appear to have acted alone, prepared bombs based on instructions in al-Qaida's English-language magazine ""Inspire.""

Obesity can be disability: EU court

This also means that just like discrimination based on religion, belief, disability, age or sexual orientation in relation to employment is prohibited, not hiring or firing someone on the basis that he or she is fat will now be prohibited.

LONDON: Employers across the European Union and UK will now have to treat obese workers as disabled.
A landmark ruling by Europe's highest court - The European Court of Justice rules that ""obesity can constitute a disability within the meaning of the Employment Equality Directive"" meaning that offices in EU and UK will be required to treat obese workers as disabled, providing them with larger seats, special parking spaces and facilities.
This also means that just like discrimination based on religion, belief, disability, age or sexual orientation in relation to employment is prohibited, not hiring or firing someone on the basis that he or she is fat will now be prohibited.
The court said, ""while no general principle of EU law prohibits discrimination on grounds of obesity, that condition falls within the concept of 'disability' where, under particular conditions, it hinders the full and effective participation of the person concerned in professional life on an equal basis with other workers.""
The court was hearing proceedings brought by a Danish child minder Karsten Kaltoft who alleged that he was dismissed by his local authority Billund Kommune due to him being obese. The authority claimed that he was unable to perform his duties, for example, needing the help of a colleague to tie a child's shoe-laces.
Legal experts had said that if Kaltoft who weighed more than 158 kg won the case, obesity would need to be approached just like any other physical or mental impairment, preventing an employer from treating an employee less favourably because of their weight. This would include the ability to dismiss.
The court said that no provision of the Treaties or of secondary EU legislation prohibits discrimination on grounds of obesity as such. In particular, the Employment Equality Directive does not cite obesity as a ground for discrimination.
As for whether obesity can constitute a 'disability' within the meaning of the directive, the court observed that the purpose of the directive is to lay down a general framework for combating discrimination, in the area of employment and occupation, on any of the grounds referred to in the directive, which include disability.
It said ""The concept of 'disability' within the meaning of the directive must be understood as referring to a limitation which results in particular from long-term physical, mental or psychological impairments which in interaction with various barriers may hinder the full and effective participation of the person concerned in professional life on an equal basis with other workers.""
Furthermore, the court observed that ""employers must take in each particular case so as to enable a person with a disability to have access to, participate in, or advance in employment (unless such measures result in a disproportionate burden being imposed on the employer).""

WASHINGTON/LOS ANGELES: The US government on Thursday said it was weighing the proportional response to the sophisticated perpetrator of a cyberattack that crippled Sony Pictures, exposed its executives and led to the cancellation of the film ""The Interview.""
Spokesman Josh Earnest said the White House is not in a position to confirm that North Korea is responsible for the hack at Sony, after a US official said Wednesday that Washington may soon formally announce the involvement of the Pyongyang government. The effect of any response, such as cyber retaliation or financial sanctions, could be limited, US experts said.
More than three weeks after the attack by hackers identifying themselves as ""Guardians of Peace"" brought down the computer network at Sony Pictures Entertainment, one of Hollywood's biggest studios grappled with the losses to its operation and reputation through sensitive leaked emails.
Sony decided on Wednesday to scrap its big Christmas Day release of ""The Interview,"" a comic film that culminates in the assassination of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. Movie theater chains said they would not show the film citing security concerns after hackers made threats against cinemas and audiences.
A senior North Korean UN diplomat declined to comment on accusations that Pyongyang was responsible for the hacking attack on Sony Pictures. He also declined to comment on the delay of the release of the film.
After the cancellation, Sony began pulling promotion of the $44 million film, dismantling the giant promotional billboard on Hollywood's famed Sunset Boulevard on Thursday.
Some of the Hollywood's biggest names howled over the cancellation of the film starring James Franco and Seth Rogen, the latter also a co-director on the movie with partner Evan Goldberg.
Steve Carell, who has starred alongside Rogen in numerous comedies, said ""Sad day for creative expression.""
The hacking could hit Carell more directly. A film project called ""Pyongyang,"" a paranoid thriller starring the actor that was to be set in North Korea, was scrapped by producer New Regency, Deadline.com reported.
Neither Rogen nor Goldberg would comment on Thursday on the fate of their film amid grassroots efforts like screenings and petitions to keep the movie alive and honor the filmmakers.
SCREENINGS CANCELLED
Three movie houses called off special screenings of 2004 Paramount Pictures puppet-comedy ""Team America: World Police"" in which a US paramilitary force tries to foil a plot by then-North Korean leader Kim Jong Il, father of Kim Jong Un.
The Alamo Drafthouse in Texas scrapped the screening because of ""circumstances beyond our control,"" while the Ohio-based Capitol Theatre and the Plaza in Atlanta said their screenings were canceled by Paramount.
Representatives for Paramount were not immediately available to comment.
Sony said Wednesday it has no further plans to release ""The Interview,"" but that has not stopped speculation that another company or maybe even Sony itself would aim for a smaller distribution some time in the future.
Sony's embattled executives continued efforts to undo damage to their reputation wrought by the leaking of sensitive emails hacked in the November attack.
Civil rights activist Reverend Al Sharpton met Thursday with Sony Pictures Co-Chairman Amy Pascal to discuss racially insensitive emails from her, included joking remarks related to US President Barack Obama and his taste in movies.
But Sharpton stopped short of asking for her resignation.
""The jury is still out on where we go with Amy,"" Sharpton said. ""We're not going to be satisfied until we see something concrete done.""
It was still unclear what the costs to Sony Pictures would be for cancelling ""The Interview"" and for the cyberattack.
Any losses will undermine Sony Corp's goal to boost results at the film studio as the money-losing conglomerate undergoes a restructuring and tries to counter flagging smartphone sales. Sony CEO Kazuo Hirai told investors in November that he aimed to lift its movie entertainment revenues by more than a third in the next three years.
While Rogen last week praised Pascal for having the courage to make the film, the long-time executive might be in a fight to keep her job because of that decision.
""If you look at some of the emails, you have to go back and research, and look at her discussions with the head of Sony overall in Japan, they never wanted to make this movie in the first place,"" Mike Paul, crisis management consultant and president of Reputation Doctor LLC, told Reuters Insider.

George Stinney Jr: Black 14-year-old boy exonerated 70 years after he was executed

George Stinney Jr became the youngest person to be executed in the US in the 20th century when he was sent to the electric chair in 1944, but more than 70 years after his death his conviction has been overturned.
Circuit Judge Carmen Mullen said the speed with which the state meted out justice against the boy was shocking and extremely unfair, and that his case was one of ""great injustice"" in her ruling exonerating Stinney Jr.
The 14-year-old black boy was sentenced to death for the murder of two white girls in a segregated mill town in South Carolina, in a trial that lasted less than three hours and reportedly bore no evidence and barely any witness testimonies.
He was kept from his parents and any legal counsel when he was interrogated by authorities, and his supporters claim that the small, frail boy was so scared that he would have said whatever he thought would make the police happy, despite there having been no physical evidence linking him to the death of the girls.
Stinney Jr and his sister Amie Ruffner were the last people to see the two girls, aged 7 and 11, alive when they were out in a field near the town of Alcolu. Stinney Jr's father had been part of the search team that found the girls' bodies hours later in a ditch, badly beaten with crushing blows to their skulls.
Stinney Jr had been arrested and executed within the space of around three months. Executioners noted that he was too small for the electric chair when he died; the straps did not fit him, an electrode was too big for his leg, and the boy had to sit on a bible to fit properly in the chair.
His case has long been spoken of as an example of how a black person could be railroaded by a justice system during the era of Jim Crow segregation laws where the investigators, prosecutors and juries where all white.
The boy's family have insisted that he was innocent, and in January they asked a local judge to order a re-trial and clear Stinney Jr's name, claiming there was new evidence about the crime.
Aime Ruffner receives support from family and friends after testifying at the hearing to reopen the case for her brother George Stinney Jr. in Sumter, South Carolina.
This time Stinney Jr's case was given a two day hearing in which experts questioned his confession and the autopsy findings, while the judge heard accounts from the boy's surviving brothers and sisters, and someone who had been involved in the search. Most of the evidence from the original trial was gone and almost all the witnesses were dead.
It took Mullen nearly four times as long to return her decision on Stinney Jr's case than it had originally taken to arrest and have him executed in 1944, and said in her ruling that she could ""think of no greater injustice"" than the boy's case.
Defense witness Katherine Stinney-Robinson leaves the stand after her testimony at the hearing to reopen the case for her brother George Stinney Jr. in Sumter, South Carolina.
Judge Mullen found that Stinney Jr's confession was ""highly likely"" to have been coerced by authorities, while few or no witnesses were found to have testified in the trial.
The judge said she was overturning the boy's conviction because the South Carolina court had failed to grant a fair trial in 1944.

COLOMBO: Sri Lanka will not allow any Arab Spring-type uprising in the country which is emerging from decades of ethnic war, President Mahinda Rajapaksa, who is seeking an unprecedented third term, vowed on Thursday as he appealed to minority Tamils to ""forget the past"".
""See what has happened in Iran, Libya and Egypt. We can't allow that type of situation in this country. We must unite. Forget the past and let us build this country together,"" Rajapaksa said, addressing minority Tamils in a public rally in the former war zone of Mullaithivu.
In the rally, the president did not mention the crushing of the LTTE who fought their final battle in Mullaithivu where a large number of people are still searching for their missing family members.
""We cannot let history repeat in this country,"" he said. The president said that he telephoned Pakistan Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif and expressed the island's sympathy over the Taliban attack at an army school in Peshawar, in which at least 132 students and 16 staffers were killed.
""I spoke with Pakistan Prime Minister on Thursday to express our sympathies over the terrorist attack on the children and their teachers,"" he said in the rally.
He emphasised on promoting economic activity in the region, saying the national budget will focus on increasing jobs for minority Tamils.
Sri Lankan troops allegedly killed about 40,000 Tamil civilians in the final months of fighting, when the leadership of the Tamil Tiger separatists was wiped out in 2009.
Tamils who account for about 15 per cent of the country's 15.5 million electorate can play a key role in deciding the next president.
Rajapaksa is touring the north of the country drumming up support for his unprecedented bid for a third term in the January 8 elections.
Rajapaksa had called the snap election last month, two years before his second term ends.
He faces his former health minister Maithripala Sirisena who defected to the opposition to become the common candidate of the opposition for the presidential election.
Sirisena led a revolt in Rajapaksa's ruling coalition, taking with him 11 ministers and lawmakers.
Rajapaksa — who was elected in 2005 and 2010 — is seeking reelection amid signs of a drop in popularity and demands of his powers to be curbed.

EU bans investment in Crimea, targets oil sector, cruises

BRUSSELS: The European Union banned investment in Crimea on Thursday, halting European help for Russian Black Sea oil and gas exploration and outlawing European cruise ships from calling at Crimean ports.
The new measures, which EU governments have signed off on and will take effect on Saturday, reinforce the EU's policy of not recognizing Moscow's annexation of Ukraine's Crimea region in March.
EU leaders, who meet in Brussels later on Thursday, will pledge to keep up pressure on Russia over its role in Ukraine despite Russia's currency crisis and ailing economy, diplomats said.
The EU is outlawing investment in Crimea, preventing Europeans and EU-based companies from buying real estate or companies in Crimea or financing Crimean companies, the bloc said in a statement.
As Reuters reported on Dec. 10, the new measure bars EU companies from exporting goods and technology used in the exploration and production of oil, gas and minerals in Crimea as well as for the transport, telecommunications and energy sectors.
European companies are also prohibited from offering technical assistance, brokering, construction or engineering services related to infrastructure in the same sectors.
Companies will no longer be allowed to offer tourism services in Crimea. European cruise ships may no longer call at ports in the Crimean peninsula, except in an emergency.
The measure applies to all ships owned or controlled by a European or flying the flag of an EU member state. Existing cruise contracts may be still be honoured until March 20.
The 28-nation EU has previously banned the import of goods from Crimea and barred new investment in infrastructure projects in the transport, telecommunications and energy sectors and investing in oil and gas ventures.
The annexation of Crimea gave Russia rich oil and gas resources in the Black Sea, depriving Ukraine of energy resources. Russian state-owned energy company Gazprom has proposed to develop Crimea's oil and gas sector.

Australian PM says cafe siege 'horrific wake-up call'

SYDNEY: Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott on Thursday admitted Sydney's cafe siege was ""a horrific wake-up call"" as details emerged of the final minutes of the standoff which left the gunman and two hostages dead.
Abbott has ordered an urgent inquiry into the circumstances surrounding the tragedy and why deranged self-styled Islamic cleric Man Haron Monis was not under surveillance given his history of extremism and violence.
The Iranian-born 50-year-old was on bail for a string of charges, including sexual offences and abetting the murder of his ex-wife.
""This has been a horrific wake-up call,"" Abbott told Macquarie Radio when asked if this was an incident waiting to happen, amid criticism that various authorities failed to act to take Monis off the streets.
""The tragedy is that this has happened. I mean, this was an atrocity, it may well have been a preventable atrocity, and that's why this swift and thorough review is so important,"" he said.
Monis, who was well known to authorities but was not on any counter-terror watchlists, took 17 people hostage at a cafe in the heart of Sydney on Monday, unfurling an Islamic flag during a 16-hour siege.
He was killed along with two victims — the cafe's manager, 34, and a 38-year-old mother-of-three — in a bloody end to the standoff.
Details of why police moved in when they did are sketchy but the father of a hostage who escaped said it was triggered by a group of them deciding they would ""not survive until the morning if they did not do something"".
Bruce Herat, the lawyer father of hostage Joel Herat, 21, said Monis was awake and agitated and had begun herding the frightened hostages into separate groups.
""And at that point in time, Joel and five others came to the conclusion that they were not going to survive until the morning if they did not do something,"" he told Fairfax Media, adding that they decided to kick down an internal door.
""And I know that Joel made sure that Harriette (Denny) ... got behind him and he said, 'You're coming with me', and basically made sure that all that group were ready to go when Joel and Jarrod (Hoffman) broke down the door.""
This group were those seen fleeing seconds before heavily-armed police stormed the Lindt cafe. Police have so far not commented on the chain of events.
Abbott has kept a high profile through the siege drama but has come under criticism from some quarters, notably about his decision to release details of a huge blow-out in the budget deficit as Australia was gripped by the unfolding Sydney events.
Influential broadcaster Ray Hadley, who has long backed Abbott and his conservative Liberal Party, told him during a face-to-face interview he rated his performance as ""D-"", saying going ahead with the budget outlook was ""a really poor call"".
The siege has touched a nerve among Australians, who began laying flowers at a makeshift memorial in the heart of Sydney's financial quarter on Tuesday.

Boko Haram kills 32, kidnaps 185 in northeastern Nigeria

MAIDUGURI, Nigeria: Boko Haram militants killed 32 people and kidnapped 185 of others, including women and children, in a brutal attack on a village in the northeast area of Nigeria, officials and a witness said on Thursday.
In neighbouring Cameroon, the Islamic extremists launched a raid on army base in the border town of Amchide, but were repelled in a fierce gun battle with troops that left 116 insurgents dead, according to Cameroon's defence ministry.
Separately, a Nigerian court martial late Wednesday sentenced 54 soldiers to death for mutiny after they refused to deploy for an operation against Boko Haram, blaming a lack of weapons and other equipment.
The court martial underscored the struggles Nigeria's military has faced in containing the five-year Islamist uprising. Civilians complain that they are left defenceless by troops who are often absent when the militants attack.
The insurgents, fighting to create an Islamic state in northern Nigeria, have seized large swathes of territory in the northeast, while cross-border violence has spread in recent months, forcing more than 1.5 million people to flee their homes.
A convoy of heavily armed Boko Haram gunmen stormed Gumsuri in Borno state on Sunday, throwing petrol bombs into buildings and leaving much of the village destroyed, two local officials and a witness said.
Both officials with the municipal government, who requested anonymity, put the death toll at 32.
They said local people were still counting the number of those abducted by the jihadists and warned that the figure could pass 100.
Details of the attack took four days to emerge from the isolated village, roughly 70km (43 miles) south of Borno's capital Maiduguri, because the mobile phone network has largely collapsed and many of the roads are impassable.
""After killing our youths, the insurgents have taken away our wives and daughters,"" said Mukhtar Buba, who fled Gumsuri to Maiduguri.
Gumsuri is located on the road that leads to Chibok, where Boko Haram abducted more than 200 girls from a school in April.
One of the local officials said the village had previously been protected against Boko Haram by a strong vigilante force, but that they were overpowered in Sunday's attack.
""For the past one year, the insurgents have made several attempts to attack Gumsuri but were resisted by the gallant youths of the village,"" he told AFP.
""It is sad that on Sunday, the village was subdued,"" he added.
The military and police were not immediately available for comment. Boko Haram has increasingly used kidnappings to boost its supply of child fighters, porters and young women who have reportedly been used as sex slaves.
Borno state is the epicentre of the Boko Haram conflict but the militants have tried to spread their uprising and want to introduce hardline Islamist rule in neighbouring Cameroon.
The defence ministry in Cameroon's capital Yaounde said Wednesday's raid in Amchide was carried out by several hundred Islamist extremists who ambushed a column of military vehicles with explosives and simultaneously attacked the army base.
Cameroonian troops retaliated instantly, the ministry said, killing 116 insurgents while one soldier has been confirmed dead and another was missing.
According to the army, the Boko Haram fighters destroyed a pick-up and a troop truck, as well as seizing another military truck intact.
The Nigerian soldiers sentenced to death were part of a special forces group that was tasked with reclaiming territory lost to Boko Haram in August.
Their court martial was conducted behind closed doors and the military did not allow journalists to cover the decision, but defence lawyer Femi Falana confirmed the sentence given to 54 soldiers. He said five of the accused were acquitted.
Frontline troops have consistently complained that they lack the weapons and other supplies needed to face Boko Haram in insurgent strongholds.
The extremists are known to have tanks, rocket-propelled grenade launchers and other heavy weaponry, while government troops have reported lacking ammunition for basic assault rifles.
Wives of soldiers have staged protests outside a military base, trying to stop their husbands from heading to conflict areas without proper hardware, while some troops have set up protest camps outside Maiduguri to demand better equipment.
Nigeria is facing huge pressure to contain the violence before general elections due on February 14, but so far there have been few signs of progress, raising fears that the vote will be cancelled across the northeast.

Boko Haram kills 32, kidnaps 185 in northeastern Nigeria

MAIDUGURI, Nigeria: Boko Haram militants killed 32 people and kidnapped 185 of others, including women and children, in a brutal attack on a village in the northeast area of Nigeria, officials and a witness said on Thursday.
In neighbouring Cameroon, the Islamic extremists launched a raid on army base in the border town of Amchide, but were repelled in a fierce gun battle with troops that left 116 insurgents dead, according to Cameroon's defence ministry.
Separately, a Nigerian court martial late Wednesday sentenced 54 soldiers to death for mutiny after they refused to deploy for an operation against Boko Haram, blaming a lack of weapons and other equipment.
The court martial underscored the struggles Nigeria's military has faced in containing the five-year Islamist uprising. Civilians complain that they are left defenceless by troops who are often absent when the militants attack.
The insurgents, fighting to create an Islamic state in northern Nigeria, have seized large swathes of territory in the northeast, while cross-border violence has spread in recent months, forcing more than 1.5 million people to flee their homes.
A convoy of heavily armed Boko Haram gunmen stormed Gumsuri in Borno state on Sunday, throwing petrol bombs into buildings and leaving much of the village destroyed, two local officials and a witness said.
Both officials with the municipal government, who requested anonymity, put the death toll at 32.
They said local people were still counting the number of those abducted by the jihadists and warned that the figure could pass 100.
Details of the attack took four days to emerge from the isolated village, roughly 70km (43 miles) south of Borno's capital Maiduguri, because the mobile phone network has largely collapsed and many of the roads are impassable.
""After killing our youths, the insurgents have taken away our wives and daughters,"" said Mukhtar Buba, who fled Gumsuri to Maiduguri.
Gumsuri is located on the road that leads to Chibok, where Boko Haram abducted more than 200 girls from a school in April.
One of the local officials said the village had previously been protected against Boko Haram by a strong vigilante force, but that they were overpowered in Sunday's attack.
""For the past one year, the insurgents have made several attempts to attack Gumsuri but were resisted by the gallant youths of the village,"" he told AFP.
""It is sad that on Sunday, the village was subdued,"" he added.
The military and police were not immediately available for comment. Boko Haram has increasingly used kidnappings to boost its supply of child fighters, porters and young women who have reportedly been used as sex slaves.
Borno state is the epicentre of the Boko Haram conflict but the militants have tried to spread their uprising and want to introduce hardline Islamist rule in neighbouring Cameroon.
The defence ministry in Cameroon's capital Yaounde said Wednesday's raid in Amchide was carried out by several hundred Islamist extremists who ambushed a column of military vehicles with explosives and simultaneously attacked the army base.
Cameroonian troops retaliated instantly, the ministry said, killing 116 insurgents while one soldier has been confirmed dead and another was missing.
According to the army, the Boko Haram fighters destroyed a pick-up and a troop truck, as well as seizing another military truck intact.
The Nigerian soldiers sentenced to death were part of a special forces group that was tasked with reclaiming territory lost to Boko Haram in August.
Their court martial was conducted behind closed doors and the military did not allow journalists to cover the decision, but defence lawyer Femi Falana confirmed the sentence given to 54 soldiers. He said five of the accused were acquitted.
Frontline troops have consistently complained that they lack the weapons and other supplies needed to face Boko Haram in insurgent strongholds.
The extremists are known to have tanks, rocket-propelled grenade launchers and other heavy weaponry, while government troops have reported lacking ammunition for basic assault rifles.
Wives of soldiers have staged protests outside a military base, trying to stop their husbands from heading to conflict areas without proper hardware, while some troops have set up protest camps outside Maiduguri to demand better equipment.
Nigeria is facing huge pressure to contain the violence before general elections due on February 14, but so far there have been few signs of progress, raising fears that the vote will be cancelled across the northeast.

Sydney hostage reveals how he planned daring escape

RELATED
SYDNEY: The siege at the Sydney cafe had been going on for more than five hours and 82-year-old John O'Brien had become convinced the gunman was insane and they would likely all end up dead.
And so he made a decision, one he knew came with a cost: he was going to try to escape.
O'Brien, a former professional tennis player who played at Wimbledon, looked at the gunman who was at the other end of the cafe, barricaded behind tables and chairs. The man had forced two or three young women to stand in front of him as human shields, so police snipers couldn't take shots at him.
O'Brien glanced up at Stefan Balafoutis, a lawyer, who was standing, as ordered, with his hands against the window. The younger man had his eyes closed.
""I said to the barrister, look, this is not going to end well, this guy will never get out of here alive, and he's going to take everyone with him,"" O'Brien told Associated Press in the first detailed account from a hostage who was held inside the cafe.
He whispered his plan to Balafoutis. The lawyer replied: ""Good idea.""
O'Brien was exhausted and was wondering at times if he was in a dream. He hadn't eaten since early in the morning, before their ordeal began, when he'd ordered a piece of raisin toast and a cappuccino.
He thought the coffee at the Lindt Chocolat Cafe in Martin Place was creamy and delicious, albeit overpriced. He liked the chocolates on display, a point of difference at the cafe. He'd visit a few times a year, often after an appointment with his eye doctor like the one he'd had that morning.
O'Brien was eating his toast when 50-year-old Man Haron Monis strode in, wearing a bandanna with Arabic writing. He pulled out a shotgun. O'Brien looked at it, thinking it was the size of a tennis racket. He knew right away the situation was dire. The gunman grabbed Tori Johnson, the 34-year-old cafe manager, ordering him to lock the door. O'Brien said Monis was immediately aggressive and belligerent.
There were 17 people in the cafe that Monday who became the gunman's hostages. Several were cafe staff in their early 20s. The customers included three lawyers and four bank workers who had popped in from nearby offices. O'Brien was the oldest while Jarrod Hoffman, a 19-year-old university student and a cafe staffer, was the youngest.
Monis ordered the customers to stand with their hands on the cafe window and to hold up a black Shahada flag with the Islamic declaration of faith written on it. O'Brien said he stood with his hands on the window for 30 minutes, or maybe 45, it was hard to tell, before telling the gunman how old he was and saying he needed to sit down.
It was his first challenge to the gunman's authority and a bit of a ruse, he said. He felt stronger than he was letting on. He's remarkably fit for his age. He still plays competitive tennis, and is among the best in Australia in his age group. As a young man, in 1956, he made it to the fourth round of Wimbledon.
Monis complained but relented, allowing O'Brien and a few others to sit.
The hours ticked by as the gunman tried to use the hostages to relay his odd demands on social media: to be delivered a flag of the Islamic State group and to speak directly to Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott.
O'Brien would sometimes rest his head on the table. He thought about his wife, Maureen, whose brother had died two weeks earlier. He thought about his two daughters. And he thought about the gunman, who he became convinced was mad.
O'Brien quietly slipped out of his seat and sat on the floor. He'd noticed that near the cafe's front doors, there was a gap between the wall and a large advertising placard, which was perhaps 10 feet (3 meters) wide and 5 feet (1.5 meters) high. He figured the gap was less than a foot (0.3 meters) wide but knew he had to squeeze behind the sign, and reach the button controlling the doors, if his plan was to work.
After several tries, he got behind the sign. Now the placard was obscuring him from the gunman. He lay down, and looked at the large green button on the wall. He wasn't sure it would open the glass doors. If it didn't, he figured, he would be seen by the gunman and killed.
Also weighing on his mind was the thought of leaving the others behind. He didn't want to, of course, and he had no way of knowing how the gunman might react.
""I was terribly worried for them,"" he said.
But there was no turning back. He reached up and pushed the green button. A moment later, at 3:37pm, the doors opened and he was free.
The images of O'Brien running toward the police in his blue blazer, glancing back with Balafoutis close behind, were played around the world. The men put their hands in the air as they reached the heavily clad officers. O'Brien took a step back out into the street, gesturing back toward the cafe, before an officer pushed him behind the front line and to safety.
Over the following hours, several more hostages escaped. The siege ended just after 2am in a barrage of gunfire when police rushed in to free the remaining captives. Two hostages, including Johnson, the cafe manager, were killed. So was the gunman.
Johnson would be hailed a hero, after reports he brought the standoff to an end by wrestling Monis for the shotgun, saving the lives of most of his fellow hostages.
O'Brien certainly considers Johnson a hero. He says he can't sleep and he can't stop thinking about Johnson and the other victim, Katrina Dawson, a 38-year-old mother of three.
""They weren't doing anything wrong,"" he said.

SYDNEY: The siege at the Sydney cafe had been going on for more than five hours and 82-year-old John O'Brien had become convinced the gunman was insane and they would likely all end up dead.
And so he made a decision, one he knew came with a cost: he was going to try to escape.

Monis ordered the customers to stand with their hands on the cafe window and to hold up a black Shahada flag with the Islamic declaration of faith written on it. O'Brien said he stood with his hands on the window for 30 minutes, or maybe 45, it was hard to tell, before telling the gunman how old he was and saying he needed to sit down.
It was his first challenge to the gunman's authority and a bit of a ruse, he said. He felt stronger than he was letting on. He's remarkably fit for his age. He still plays competitive tennis, and is among the best in Australia in his age group. As a young man, in 1956, he made it to the fourth round of Wimbledon.
Monis complained but relented, allowing O'Brien and a few others to sit.
The hours ticked by as the gunman tried to use the hostages to relay his odd demands on social media: to be delivered a flag of the Islamic State group and to speak directly to Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott.
O'Brien would sometimes rest his head on the table. He thought about his wife, Maureen, whose brother had died two weeks earlier. He thought about his two daughters. And he thought about the gunman, who he became convinced was mad.
O'Brien quietly slipped out of his seat and sat on the floor. He'd noticed that near the cafe's front doors, there was a gap between the wall and a large advertising placard, which was perhaps 10 feet (3 meters) wide and 5 feet (1.5 meters) high. He figured the gap was less than a foot (0.3 meters) wide but knew he had to squeeze behind the sign, and reach the button controlling the doors, if his plan was to work.
After several tries, he got behind the sign. Now the placard was obscuring him from the gunman. He lay down, and looked at the large green button on the wall. He wasn't sure it would open the glass doors. If it didn't, he figured, he would be seen by the gunman and killed.
Also weighing on his mind was the thought of leaving the others behind. He didn't want to, of course, and he had no way of knowing how the gunman might react.
""I was terribly worried for them,"" he said.
But there was no turning back. He reached up and pushed the green button. A moment later, at 3:37pm, the doors opened and he was free.
The images of O'Brien running toward the police in his blue blazer, glancing back with Balafoutis close behind, were played around the world. The men put their hands in the air as they reached the heavily clad officers. O'Brien took a step back out into the street, gesturing back toward the cafe, before an officer pushed him behind the front line and to safety.
Over the following hours, several more hostages escaped. The siege ended just after 2am in a barrage of gunfire when police rushed in to free the remaining captives. Two hostages, including Johnson, the cafe manager, were killed. So was the gunman.
Johnson would be hailed a hero, after reports he brought the standoff to an end by wrestling Monis for the shotgun, saving the lives of most of his fellow hostages.
O'Brien certainly considers Johnson a hero. He says he can't sleep and he can't stop thinking about Johnson and the other victim, Katrina Dawson, a 38-year-old mother of three.
""They weren't doing anything wrong,"" he said.

Poll: 80 percent back Putin even as ruble falls
AP | Dec 18, 2014, 11.56 AM IST
Russian President Vladimir Putin.
RELATED
MOSCOW: From a Western perspective, Vladimir Putin's days as president of Russia should be numbered: The ruble has lost more than half its value, the economy is in crisis and his aggression in Ukraine has turned the country into an international pariah.
And yet most Russians see Putin not as the cause, but as the solution.
The situation as seen from a Russian point of view is starkly different from that painted in the West, and it is driven largely by state television's carefully constructed version of reality and the Kremlin's methodical dismantling of every credible political alternative.
As Putin prepares to face his public in a much-anticipated televised news conference, an Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll released Thursday found that about 80 percent of Russians still support him.
But it also showed that confidence in the economy is slipping. This is particularly true in Moscow, where people have become accustomed to imported goods and foreign travel, now once again off-limits for many because of the fall of the ruble and Western sanctions over Ukraine.
The poll was conducted between November 22 and December 7, when the ruble was steadily declining. But this week's catastrophic collapse is likely to have a much greater effect on consumer prices and the standard of living.
For Putin, the question is whether he will be able to convince Russians to tighten their belts, and not just for a few months but possibly for years to come.
""The Russian people have a sense that they are under sanctions, they are a fortress under siege,"" said Maria Lipman, an independent analyst. ""This kind of mentality is disseminated consistently and steadily by Russian television: Who else is there to rely on except Putin? Putin is seen as the savior of the nation, and I think he sees himself in this fashion.""
Putin will address his countrymen's concerns over the course of three or four hours at Thursday's news conference. He seems all but certain to send the message that he is in charge and all is fine.
An advertisement for the news conference running on state television shows Putin surrounded by Sochi Olympic athletes, petting a baby tiger and greeting cosmonauts. ""We are absolutely capable of doing everything ourselves,"" he promises the audience.
How Russians view Putin is associated with how they get their news, the poll showed. Those who identified state television as their main source of news are more likely to approve of Putin (84 percent) than those who have other sources (73 percent), while those who tune into the news often also have a more favorable opinion of him.
After becoming president in 2000, Putin benefited from high prices for oil, the mainstay of Russia's economy. In the past decade, Russians saw their living standards rise faster than at any other point in modern history, transforming many average citizens into car owners and globe-trotters for the first time ever.
The suppression of opposition politicians and independent media, widely criticized by outside observers, was tacitly accepted by many as a compromise worth making for economic stability after the roller coaster years of the 1990s.
""I very much support Putin - who else is there to support?"" said Valentina Roshupkina, a 79-year-old resident of Gryaz, a town several hours' drive south of Moscow. ""The country is moving in the right direction, I believe, because he lifted up the army, he made the government stronger. People started to be a little bit afraid of us.""
Poll respondents were asked whether they would be willing to speak with an AP reporter, and Roshupkina was among the many who agreed.
With the Russian economy buffeted by Western sanctions and the fall in oil prices, Putin has relied even more on his image as a tough leader capable of standing up to the West. He appears to be betting that this will help him weather the economic storm.
So far he's been right: The presidency and the military are the country's most trusted institutions, according to the poll, with three out of four Russians saying they trust the presidency and two out of three expressing faith in the military.
""We've revived the army and that's very important,"" said Ivan Savenko, a 50-year-old driver in the southern city of Stavropol who also took part in the poll. ""For us, the most important thing is the army and then everything else. It's important for us that our country is a power. If we are not a power, we do not exist.""
Of those surveyed, 81 percent said they strongly or somewhat approve of the way Putin is handling his job, a dramatic increase of more than 20 percentage points from an AP-GfK poll conducted in 2012.
While Russia has become more authoritarian under Putin, the support for him appears genuine. The significant fluctuation in Putin's ratings in recent years also indicates that Russians feel able to respond freely in anonymous surveys about their views on the president. The 81 percent approval rating is only slightly higher statistically than the 74 percent measured during the same time period by the Levada Center, Russia's most respected independent pollster.
Many analysts question, however, whether the high ratings have any significance, given the Kremlin's control over information.
""There is a total, effective, monopolistic propaganda campaign, and if there is an information monopoly, how can you talk about ratings?"" said Georgy Satarov, a former Kremlin adviser who heads a research institute that studies corruption.
""The thing you have to pay attention to is not the fact that 80 percent support him, but that despite that information monopoly 15 percent don't support him,"" he said.
Support for Putin soared after he moved to seize the Russian-speaking Crimean Peninsula from Ukraine in March.
""A source of pride for the overwhelming majority of Russians is the victory of World War II, but that was already 70 years ago,"" Lipman said. ""(In Crimea) Putin gave the sense that we are victorious and triumphant and resurgent today.""
The Russia-backed separatists who took up arms against government troops in eastern Ukraine also have been portrayed as heroes on state television. Of the Russians polled, 69 percent said that many or some parts of Ukraine rightfully belong to Russia.
But some, like 37-year-old librarian Yelena Shevilyova, said that although she approves of Putin, she believes Russia's involvement in Ukraine may have come at too high a cost.
""I think we lost a lot in our lives because of this,"" said Shevilyova, another poll participant, referring to Crimea.
""I think that it is right to bring all of these (Russian-speaking regions) back, but we need everything to be good here too. ... You can't have everything at once,"" she said, speaking from the far northern region of Perm.
Growing worries about a worsening economy and the impact of sanctions are more keenly felt in major cities. In Moscow, more than 6 in 10 said they had been negatively affected by the sanctions and most said their family's finances were worse than three years ago. Less than half felt that way elsewhere.
""I am afraid that Russia isn't going anywhere,"" said Dmitry Uryupin, 48, a sound director in a small production firm in Moscow who was among those surveyed. ""It's unlikely that wages will be raised. In fact, it's quite likely the opposite will happen, unemployment will rise and it will all affect the most economically insecure people as well as us, the creative class.""
After Putin was inaugurated for a third term in 2012 after a wave of protests in Moscow driven by the creative class, he clamped down even harder on the opposition and focused on his core electorate: people in the provinces and those more dependent on the state for their income.
The disgruntled in Moscow have proved easy to discredit in the eyes of what is known as the Putin majority: ""Look at these poor Muscovites. ... Oh my God, they complain because they cannot go to Italy on vacation and they can no longer afford to buy Parmesan cheese!"" Lipman said.
Whether discontent not just with the economy but with Putin's leadership will grow, Lipman said, depends on ""how badly this will hurt, and for how long.""
The AP-NORC Center poll of Russia was conducted by NORC at the University of Chicago with fieldwork for the in-person survey by GfK Russia from November 22-December 7. It is based on 2,008 in person interviews with a nationally representative random sample of Russians age 18 and older.
Funding for the survey came from NORC at the University of Chicago.
Results for all adults have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 2.4 percentage points.

Cubans hope for better future with US-Havana deal

HAVANA: Cubans cheered the surprise announcement that their country will restore relations with the United States, hopeful they'll soon see expanded trade and new economic vibrancy even though the 53-year-old economic embargo remains in place for the time being.
""This opens a better future for us,"" said Milagros Diaz, 34. ""We have really needed something like this because the situation has been bad and the people very discouraged.""
Bells tolled in celebration and teachers halted lessons midday as  President Raul Castro told his country on Wednesday that Cuba would renew relations with Washington after more than a half-century of hostility.
Wearing his military uniform with its five-star insignia, the 83-year-old leader said the two countries would work to resolve their differences ""without renouncing a single one of our principles.""
Havana residents gathered around television sets in homes, schools and businesses to hear the historic national broadcast, which coincided with a statement by US President Barack Obama in Washington. Uniformed schoolchildren burst into applause at the news.
At the University of San Geronimo in the capital's historic center, the announcement drew ringing from the bell tower. Throughout the capital, there was a sense of euphoria as word spread.
""For the Cuban people, I think this is like a shot of oxygen, a wish-come-true, because with this, we have overcome our differences,"" said Carlos Gonzalez, a 32-year-old IT specialist. ""It is an advance that will open the road to a better future for the two countries.""
Fidel and  Raul Castro led the 1959 rebellion that toppled the dictatorship of Fulgencio Batista. The US initially recognized the new government but broke relations in 1961 after Cuba veered sharply to the left and nationalized US-owned businesses.
As Cuba turned toward the Soviet Union, the US imposed a trade embargo in 1962. Particularly since the collapse of the USSR in 1991, Cubans have confronted severe shortages of oil, food and consumer goods, forcing them to ration everything from beans to powdered milk.
The Cuban government blames most of its economic travails on the embargo, while Washington has traditionally blamed Cuba's Communist economic policies.
In his address, Castro called on Washington to end its trade embargo which, he said, ""has caused enormous human and economic damage.""
Ramon Roman, 62, said he hoped to see Cuba welcome more tourists. ""It would be a tremendous economic injection, both in terms of money and in new energy and would be a boost for average people who need it,"" he said.
Victoria Serrano, a lab worker, said she hoped to see an influx of new goods because life in Cuba has been ""really very difficult.""
""In particular,"" she said, ""I hope we'll see an improvement in food _ that there is trade in this with the United States, which is so close. Right now, even an onion has become a luxury.""
Around the cathedral in Old Havana, people gathered in doorways and on sidewalks, gesturing excitedly as they discussed the news.
Guillermo Delgado, a 72-year-old retiree, welcomed the announcement as ""a victory for Cuba because it was achieved without conceding basic principles.""
Yoani Sanchez, a renowned Cuban blogger critical of the government, noted the development came with a price. Castro, she said, could now claim a triumph and that he had made a ""bargaining chip"" of Alan Gross, the US aid worker who was released from prison Wednesday while the US freed three Cubans held as spies.
""In this way, the Castro regime has managed to get its way,"" she wrote in a blog post. ""It has managed to exchange a peaceful man, embarked on the humanitarian adventure of providing Internet connectivity to a group of Cubans, for intelligence agents that caused significant damage and sorrow with their actions.""
Some dissidents expressed their displeasure at not being consulted by the US government about the historic move.
Dissident Guillermo Farinas considered the move a ""betrayal"" by Obama who, he said, had promised that they would be consulted. Another activist, Antonio Rodiles, said the measure ""sends a bad message.""
Others, meanwhile, were cautious, saying they'll wait and see what it all means.
""It's not enough since it doesn't lift the blockade,"" said Pedro Duran, 28. ""We'll see if it's true, if it's not like everything here: one step forward and three steps back. For now, I don't think there will be any immediate improvement after we've been living like this for 50 years.""

NEW YORK: Under the threat of terrorist attacks from hackers and with the nation's largest multiplex chains pulling the film from their screens,  Sony Pictures Entertainment took the unprecedented step of canceling the Dec. 25 release of the  Seth Rogen comedy ''The Interview.''
The cancellation announced Wednesday was a startling blow to the Hollywood studio that has been shaken by hacker leaks and intimidations over the last several weeks by an anonymous group calling itself  Guardians of Peace.
A U.S. official said Wednesday that federal investigators have now connected the Sony hacking to North Korea and are expected to make an announcement in the near future. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because the official was not authorized to openly discuss an ongoing criminal case.
Sony said it was cancelling ``The Interview'' release ``in light of the decision by the majority of our exhibitors not to show the film.'' The studio said it respected and shared in the exhibitors' concerns.
``We are deeply saddened at this brazen effort to suppress the distribution of a movie, and in the process do damage to our company, our employees, and the American public,'' read the statement. ``We stand by our filmmakers and their right to free expression and are extremely disappointed by this outcome.''
Seemingly putting to rest any hope of a delayed theatrical release or a video-on-demand release Sony Pictures spokesperson Jean Guerin later added: ``Sony Pictures has no further release plans for the film.''
Earlier Wednesday, Regal Cinemas, AMC Entertainment and Cinemark Theatres _ the three top theater chains in North America _ announced that they were postponing any showings of ``The Interview.'' The comedy, about a TV host (James Franco) and producer (Rogen) tasked by the CIA to assassinate North Korea leader Kim Jung-un (played by Randall Park), has inflamed North Korea for parodying its leader.
Regal said in a statement that it was delaying ``The Interview'' ``due to wavering support of the film ... by Sony Pictures, as well as the ambiguous nature of any real or perceived security threats.'' AMC noted ``the overall confusion and uncertainty'' surrounding the film.
Sony had offered theaters the option of bowing out, and when so many of them did (other chains to drop it included ArcLight Cinemas, Cineplex Entertainment and Carmike Cinemas), Sony was left with little choice.
On Tuesday, the hacking group threatened violence at ``the very times and places'' showing ``The Interview.'' The Department of Homeland Security said Tuesday there was ``no credible intelligence to indicate an active plot against movie theaters,'' but noted it was still analyzing messages from the group. The warning did prompt law enforcement in New York and Los Angeles to address measures to ramp up security.
President Barack Obama commented the hacking Wednesday in an interview with ABC News.
``The cyberattack is very serious,'' said Obama. ``We're investigating and we're taking it seriously. We'll be vigilant. If we see something that we think is serious and credible then we'll alert the public. But for now, my recommendation would be that people go to the movies.''
With a modest budget of about $40 million, ``The Interview'' was predicted to earn around $30 million in its opening weekend before Tuesday's threats. Sony also stands to lose tens of millions in marketing costs already incurred.
``This attack went to the heart and core of Sony's business _ and succeeded,'' said Avivah Litan, a cybersecurity analyst at research firm Gartner. ``We haven't seen any attack like this in the annals of U.S. breach history.''
Sony was also under pressure from other studios. Christmas is one of the most important box-office weekends of the year, and the threats could have scared moviegoers away. Releases include Universal's ``Unbroken,'' Paramount's ``The Gambler,'' and Disney's ``Into the Woods.'' Sony's musical ``Annie,'' also expected to be a big earner, debuts Friday.
Doug Stone, president of film industry newsletter Box Office Analyst, had predicted that ``The Interview'' could have made $75 to $100 million. With Sony taking about 55 percent of domestic revenues, that could mean a $41 to $55 million revenue loss, according to Stone.
Sony's announcement was met with widespread distress across Hollywood and by others watching the unfolding attack on Sony. A former senior national security official in the George W. Bush administration said the company made the wrong decision.
``When you are confronted with a bully the idea is not to cave but to punch him in the nose,'' Fran Townsend, Bush's homeland security adviser, said Wednesday during a previously scheduled appearance in Washington. ``This is a horrible, I think, horrible precedent.''

Mass grave of 230 killed by jihadists found in Syria: monitor

BEIRUT: The bodies of 230 people killed by the  Islamic State group have been found in a mass grave uncovered by their relatives in Syria's Deir Ezzor province, a monitoring group said Wednesday.
The discovery brings the number of Shaitat tribal members slain during the jihadists' summer advance in Deir Ezzor province near Iraq to more than 900, the  Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said.
The Britain-based group said it had ""learned from trusted sources that more than 230 bodies have been found in a mass grave in the desert near  Al-Kashkiyeh in the east of Deir Ezzor"".
The ""vast majority"" were civilians, many of them executed in cold blood after the tribe rose up against the Islamic State after it had driven out rival jihadists and rebels from the area.
IS controls large swathes of northern and eastern Syria, as well as parts of neighbouring Iraq.
Hundreds more members of the Shaitat tribe are still missing, said the Observatory, which relies on a large network of activists, doctors and military sources on all sides of the Syrian conflict for its reports.
The tribespeople discovered the grave as they returned to their villages from months of displacement after losing their battle against IS.
They have been allowed to return only after agreeing to respect an IS-imposed curfew, as well as a prohibition on gatherings and weapons.
Anyone who fights IS, according to the jihadists' rules, will be considered a heretic and executed.
The jihadist group first emerged in Syria's war in spring 2013 and has since committed some of the war's worst atrocities.
Reported discoveries of such graves have been rare in the Syrian conflict, which broke out in March 2011 when President Bashar al-Assad's forces unleashed a bloody crackdown on pro-democracy protests.
In February, when IS withdrew from Aazaz, in the northern province of Aleppo, the Observatory said a possible mass grave was found in the town.
But such atrocities have been much more frequent in neighbouring Iraq, where thousands of people have gone missing since the jihadists overran large parts of the country this year.

"116","Apple 'failing to protect workers'","Poor treatment of workers in the Chinese factories which make Apple products is discovered by an undercover BBC Panorama investigation.","Apple 'failing to protect Chinese factory workers'
By Richard Bilton BBC Panorama
Richard Bilton reports from Shanghai: ''An exhausted workforce''
Poor treatment of workers in Chinese factories which make Apple products has been discovered by an undercover BBC Panorama investigation.
Filming on an iPhone 6 production line showed Apple's promises to protect workers were routinely broken.
It found standards on workers' hours, ID cards, dormitories, work meetings and juvenile workers were being breached at the Pegatron factories.
Apple said it strongly disagreed with the programme's conclusions.
Exhausted workers were filmed falling asleep on their 12-hour shifts at the Pegatron factories on the outskirts of Shanghai.
One undercover reporter, working in a factory making parts for Apple computers, had to work 18 days in a row despite repeated requests for a day off.
Another reporter, whose longest shift was 16 hours, said: ""Every time I got back to the dormitories, I wouldn't want to move.
""Even if I was hungry I wouldn't want to get up to eat.  I just wanted to lie down and rest. I was unable to sleep at night because of the stress.""
'Continuous improvement'
Apple declined to be interviewed for the programme, but said in a statement: ""We are aware of no other company doing as much as Apple to ensure fair and safe working conditions.
""We work with suppliers to address shortfalls, and we see continuous and significant improvement, but we know our work is never done.""
Apple said it was a very common practice for workers to nap during breaks, but it would investigate any evidence they were falling asleep while working.
It said it monitored the working hours of more than a million workers and that staff at Pegatron were averaging 55 hours a week.

The poor conditions in Chinese factories were highlighted in 2010 when 14 workers killed themselves at Apple's biggest supplier, Foxconn.
Following the suicides, Apple published a set of standards spelling out how factory workers should be treated. It also moved some of its production work to Pegatron's factories on the outskirts of Shanghai.
But Panorama's undercover reporters found that these standards were routinely breached on the factory floor.
Overtime is supposed to be voluntary, but none of the reporters were offered any choice. In addition to the excessive hours, one reporter had to attend unpaid meetings before and after work.  Another reporter was housed in a dormitory where 12 workers shared a cramped room.
Apple says the dormitory overcrowding has now been resolved and that it requires suppliers to retroactively pay workers if it finds they haven't been paid for work meetings.
Pegatron said it was carefully investigating Panorama's claims and would take all necessary action if any deficiencies were found at their facilities.
""Worker safety and well-being are our top priorities. We set very high standards, conduct rigorous training for managers and workers, and have external auditors regularly visiting our facilities to find areas for improvement,"" a statement said.
Dangerous conditions
Panorama also travelled further down Apple's supply chain to the Indonesian island of Bangka.
Apple says it is dedicated to the ethical sourcing of minerals, but the programme found evidence that tin from illegal mines could be entering its supply chain.
It found children digging tin ore out by hand in extremely dangerous conditions - miners can be buried alive when the walls of sand or mud collapse.
Rainto, 12, said he was worried about landslides
Twelve-year-old Rianto was working with his dad at the bottom of a 70-foot cliff of sand. He said: ""I worry about landslides. The earth slipping from up there to the bottom. It could happen.""
Panorama tracked down a gang who collect tin from the area where Rianto was working. One of them said they sold tin to a smelter on Apple's list of suppliers.
Johan Murod, who runs one of the smelters on Apple's list, said 70% of the tin that is exported comes from the small-scale mines.
""At the smelter there's everything from both large and small scale mines. It's all mixed.  There's no way to know what is legal and what is illegal.""
Apple says it is a complex situation on Bangka with tens of thousands of miners selling tin through many middle men.
""The simplest course of action would be for Apple to unilaterally refuse any tin from Indonesian mines. That would be easy for us to do and would certainly shield us from criticism.
""But that would also be the lazy and cowardly path, since it would do nothing to improve the situation. We have chosen to stay engaged and attempt to drive changes on the ground.""

Minecraft maker Mojang plans spin-off game
The spin-off is being made by Telltale Games which has worked on titles with more adult themes than those seen in Minecraft
Microsoft will 'respect' Minecraft
Minecraft maker Mojang is planning a spin-off game based on its hugely popular block-building title.
Called Minecraft: Story Mode, it will be an episodic game set in the familiar Minecraft world but will introduce some new characters into the setting.
The game is being made by Telltale Games which has produced several other episodic titles.
The first episode is due to be released in 2015 on consoles, PCs, Macs and Android devices.
So far, little information about what it will be like have been released. Mojang has produced a short browser-based game called Info Quest II to explain what it might be like.
In a blogpost, Mojang said the game would be developed with the help of the Minecraft community.
It sought to reassure players that Story Mode would not be like the violent and bloody games Telltale has produced before now. Recent Telltale games include The Wolf Among Us, Tales from the Borderlands and titles based on Game of Thrones and zombie thriller The Walking Dead.
""Telltale's game will feel similar in tone to Minecraft itself,"" said Mojang, ""though it's a totally original take inspired by our game.""
The news about Story Mode comes soon after Mojang released a finished version of its Scrolls card-based magic battling game.

By spoofing emails attackers tricked Icann staff into handing over login names and passwords
Hackers have managed to penetrate the network used by the organisation that oversees the net.
Icann, which administers the net's addressing system, said spoofed emails were used to reach an internal network.
The attackers used this access to steal lists of contact and login information for people who control some of the net's most popular domains.
Icann said it had notified people that their data may have gone astray and asked them to change their passwords.
Icann, the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers, was set up to oversee the underlying addressing system that keeps the net running and ensures data gets where it is supposed to go.
In a blogpost , Icann said some of its staff were tricked into opening booby-trapped email messages sent by attackers that were crafted to look like they came from other employees.
The attack took place in late November and Icann realised it had been attacked about a week later.
The booby-trapped emails helped the attackers capture login name and password details for Icann's internal network that attackers then used to snoop around the organisation's systems.
An investigation by Icann revealed that the attackers got at a system called the Centralised Zone Data System (CZDS) that lists who looks after what is known as generic top-level domains. This includes the widely used .com, .info, .net and .org domains as well as a host of other more recently established domains.
Icann said it was not possible to alter any details of who administers these domains from its CZDS system.
Passwords were stored in a hard to crack format, said Icann, and added it had deactivated passwords so those with legitimate access to CZDS would have to generate a new one.
""Based on our investigation to date, we are not aware of any other systems that have been compromised,"" it said, adding that it had now put in place more stringent security systems to prevent another breach.

"119","Snapchat boss tearful at Sony hack","Snapchat founder Evan Spiegel left ""devastated"" as plans for his messaging app are leaked as part of the Sony Pictures hack.","'Angry' Snapchat embroiled in Sony Pictures hack
By Dave Lee Technology reporter, BBC News
Snapchat boss Evan Spiegel said keeping company secrets was ""painful""
A guide to the Sony Pictures hack
Snapchat founder Evan Spiegel has said he is ""devastated"" and ""angry"" that plans for his messaging app were leaked as part of the Sony Pictures hack.
Details of future ideas and strategy were outlined by Mr Spiegel in emails to Michael Lynton, a Sony executive who sits on Snapchat's board.
Also included were details, including financial data, on previously unpublicised acquisitions.
""I felt like I was going to cry all morning,"" Mr Spiegel said in a memo.
""I went on a walk and thought through a couple things.""
'Huge hug'
Mr Spiegel later shared on Twitter the emotional note he sent to Snapchat's employees, entitled Keeping Secrets.
""I've been feeling a lot of things since our business plans were made public last night,"" he wrote.
""Definitely angry. Definitely devastated.
Acquisitions made by messaging app Snapchat have been made public
""I want to give you all a huge hug because keeping secrets is exhausting.
""Keeping secrets means coming home late, after working all day and night. Curling up with your loved ones, hanging out with your friends, and not being able to share all of the incredible things you're working on. It's painful, it's tiring.""
The leak detailed big ambitions for the popular app which allows users to send messages - images or video - that disappear after a short period of time.
According to the emails, the company purchased Vergence Labs, an eyewear company that produced a product comparable to Google Glass.
Snapchat also spent millions on Scan.me, a firm specialising in QR codes and advertising platform iBeacon.
'Undetectable' threat
Mr Spiegel's staff memo does not comment on the acquisitions, nor does it suggest the company planned to take any legal action against Sony or any other party.
Sony Pictures' legal woes are beginning to mount after the hack attack that has seen it cancel plans to release The Interview, a comedy about North Korea.
Snapchat acquired Vergence Labs, a company that makes a Google Glass-like product
Earlier this week, two former Sony Pictures employees filed a lawsuit accusing the company of not properly securing private data.
Around 15,000 employees had personal information, including social security numbers, leaked following the hack.
Sony Pictures said the attack was ""unprecedented"", and that the threat was ""undetectable by industry-standard antivirus software"".
Mr Spiegel has said he will spend some time being ""angry and upset"" before getting back to work.
""It's not fair that the people who try to build us up and break us down get a glimpse of who we really are.
""It's not fair that people get to take away all the hard work we've done to surprise our community, family and friends.""

"120","Windows browser choice system ends","A requirement for Microsoft to offer new Windows users in Europe a choice of web browsers has ended after five years","Deal forcing Microsoft to offer browser choices ends
The browser ballot screen helped introduce people to non-Microsoft products, said the European Commission
A requirement for Microsoft to offer new Windows users in Europe a choice of web browsers has ended after five years.
Called the browser ballot, it gave non-Microsoft browsers as much prominence on Windows as Internet Explorer (IE).
The requirement was drawn up in 2009 after Microsoft's rivals complained the software giant's bundling of IE with Windows gave it an unfair advantage.
About 70% of people used IE in 2009 but its market share has since declined.
Estimates from browser analysis companies suggest that IE is now used by between 20 and 25% of all people going online from a desktop PC. Google's Chrome browser, first released in 2008, is the most popular with a 50% share and about 20% of people use Firefox.
The browser ballot was only seen in Europe on new PCs running Windows XP, Vista and 7 and on machines where a fresh copy of those versions of Windows was installed.
The European Commission said offering people a choice of browser had proved successful and that in its first eight months 84 million browsers were downloaded via the choice screen.
Microsoft was threatened with heavy fines if it did not properly implement and maintain the ballot. It was hit with a 561m euro (£441m) fine in March 2013 because it failed to include the ballot screen on Windows 7  Service Pack 1 for 14 months.
The browser choice system was agreed on 16 December, 2009 and was first seen on copies of Windows in March 2010.
News about the ending of the ballot emerged from a service update Microsoft posted to its support site . In that note it gave advice to system administrators about how to turn off the ballot screen.

The falling value of the rouble means games on Steam are cheap if bought via Russia
Steam Broadcasting takes on Twitch
The plunging value of the Russian rouble has led game maker Valve to impose limits on its online store.
It has started putting ""region-locks"" on games bought via its Steam service in Russia so only people in that country can play them.
The move is an attempt to stop people outside the country buying games that are far cheaper from the Russian store.
Many games costing $40 (£25) on the US Steam store cost only a few dollars in Russia.
The Steam Prices website, which logs price differences across the regional Steam game networks, reveals many games are currently up to 10 times more expensive in the US and UK than they are in Russia.
Falling oil prices and economic sanctions have conspired to cause the value of the rouble to lose more than half its value against the US dollar this year. Earlier this week one dollar was worth 79 roubles though the currency has recovered since and now $1 buys about 61 roubles.
Valve's move is the first time that region locks have been imposed on games available via the hugely popular Steam service. Valve has yet to issue a comment on its decision to lock games.
Earlier this week Apple also reacted to the economic turmoil in Russia by halting sales made via the Russian version of its online store. It said exchange rates were too volatile for it to set prices.

EE to end Orange Wednesday deal
An agreement has been reached between the government and the country's biggest mobile networks to improve mobile coverage across the UK.
EE, O2, Three and Vodafone have agreed to invest £5bn and guarantee coverage across 90% of the UK by 2017.
The move should reduce the number of ""not-spots"", areas of patchy coverage.
The firms had rejected the government's preferred option of a system allowing customers of one network to use another if their supplier wasn't available.
""I am pleased to have secured a legally binding deal with the four mobile networks,"" said Culture Secretary Sajid Javid.
""Too many parts of the UK regularly suffer from poor mobile coverage leaving them unable to make calls or send texts,"" he said.
The agreement should reduce total ""not-spots"", where there is no mobile coverage, by two-thirds, the government said.
'Great result'
Partial ""not-spots"", areas where there is some coverage but not from all four networks, should be reduced by half, and full coverage from all four operators will increase by 69% to 85% by 2017.
Telecoms regulator Ofcom will enforce the deal.
Olaf Swantee, chief executive of EE, said: ""This agreement ensures that our customers are able to stay connected in even more places up and down the country.""
A Vodafone UK spokesman said it supported the government's objective of delivering better coverage to rural areas including partial not-spots.
""The voluntary industry commitment we have agreed with the government today will deliver 90% of the UK's land mass with voice services and a major improvement in mobile internet coverage as well.
""It is a great result for UK consumers and businesses and it will make the UK a leader across Europe in terms of the reach of mobile coverage,"" the spokesman said.
No cash payments will be made by the government to the mobile networks as part of the agreement.

The Classic has an eight-megapixel camera on its reverse and, as well as the physical keyboard, the device can be controlled via its 3.5-inch touchscreen.
Blackberry has had a challenging year, albeit one showing at least some positive signs for the company formerly known as Research in Motion.
News in March of annual losses of $5.9bn (£3.5bn) highlighted the company's slip from being a major smartphone player.
However, after significant cost-cutting, and with higher profit margins, the company was able to overcome a drop in revenues to post a profit of $23m (£14m) for the three months to the end of March 2014.
More recently, the company impressed technology enthusiasts with the Blackberry Passport, a distinctive smartphone which, like the Classic, made use of a physical keyboard.
The Blackberry Passport's distinctive design proved popular
""Knowing your strengths and recognising your weaknesses could be Blackberry's way back from the brink,"" said Rob Kerr, mobiles expert at Uswitch.com.
""Like its Passport phone, the mobile maker has gone back to its roots with the Classic - furnishing it with the physical keyboard that so many appreciate in the touchscreen era.
""Keyboard phones were always its strong point and this true return to form hails back to Blackberry's glory days.
""Although this handset is unlikely to capture the once strong youth market, businesses might once again come back to the fold.""
Blackberry's executive chairman, John Chen, said the Classic was built after gathering feedback from ""dedicated"" users.
He added: ""By bringing back the trusted functionalities, incorporating our latest operating system and building a speedier browser, our users can feel confident they are using the best communications tool out there.""

"124","Google considers data risk warnings","Google is proposing to warn people their data is at risk every time they visit websites that do not use the ""HTTPS"" system.","Google considers warning internet users about data risks
Currently only about 33% of websites use the more secure HTTPS system
Google is proposing to warn people their data is at risk every time they visit websites that do not use the ""HTTPS"" system.
Many sites have adopted the secure version of the basic web protocol to help safeguard data.
The proposal was made by the Google developers working on the search firm's Chrome browser.
Security experts broadly welcomed the proposal but said it could cause confusion initially.
Scrambled data
The proposal to mark HTTP connections as non-secure was made in a message posted to the Chrome development website by Google engineers working on the firm's browser.
If implemented, the developers wrote, the change would mean that a warning would pop-up when people visited a site that used only HTTP to notify them that such a connection ""provides no data security"".
It will be a good thing for the whole web in the long run”
End Quote Paul Mutton Netcraft
The team said it was odd that browsers currently did nothing to warn people when their data was unprotected.
""The only situation in which web browsers are guaranteed not to warn users is precisely when there is no chance of security,"" they wrote.
HTTPS uses well-established cryptographic systems to scramble data as it travels from a user's computer to a website and back again.
The team said warnings were needed because it was known that cyber thieves and government agencies were abusing insecure connections to steal data or spy on people.
Rik Ferguson, a senior analyst at security firm Trend Micro, said warning people when they were using an insecure connection was ""a good idea"".
""People seem to make the assumption that communications such as HTTP and email are private to a degree when exactly the opposite is the case,"" he said.
Website operators might need help adopting the HTTPS system, say experts
Letting people know when their connection to a website is insecure could drive sites to adopt more secure protocols, he said.
Currently only about 33% of websites use HTTPS, according to statistics gathered by the Trustworthy Internet Movement which monitors the way sites use more secure browsing technologies.
'Headache'
Paul Mutton, a security analyst at web monitoring firm Netcraft, also welcomed the proposal, saying it was ""bizarre"" that an unencrypted HTTP connection gave rise to no warnings at all.
""In the short term, the biggest headache is likely to be faced by website operators who will feel forced to migrate unencrypted HTTP websites to encrypted HTTPS,"" he said. Many may resent the cost in time and money required to adopt the technology, he said, even though projects exist to make it easier and free for website administrators to use HTTPS.
""It will seem like a lot of hassle in the short term, but it will be a good thing for the whole web in the long run,"" he said.
The Google proposal was also floated on discussion boards for other browsers and received guarded support from the Mozilla team behind the Firefox browser and those involved with Opera.
Many large websites and services, including Twitter, Yahoo, Facebook and GMail, already use HTTPS by default. In addition, since September Google has prioritised HTTPS sites in its search rankings.

"125","Jeans made to block wireless signals","Jeans that block wireless RFID signals, prevent hackers accessing card details, are to go on sale.","Jeans made that will prevent 'digital pickpocketing'
The jeans have pockets that block RFID signals
The rise of the Swedish cyborgs
A pair of jeans containing material that blocks wireless signals is being developed in conjunction with anti-virus firm Norton.
The trousers are intended to stop thieves hacking into radio frequency identification (RFID) tagged passports or contactless payment cards.
According to security experts this type of theft is a growing problem.
The jeans are designed by online clothing company Betabrand and use a silver-based material to block signals.
They are due to go on sale in February.
Security software maker Norton teamed up with San Francisco-based Betabrand in October to make the jeans and a blazer. The jeans will retail at $151 (£96) and the blazer at $198.
The majority of credit and debit cards are fitted with Near Field Communication chips, a type of RFID tech
Digital forensic firm Disklabs has used similar technology to make a wallet, which, like the Betabrand jeans, blocks RFID signals.
""There is technology readily available for anyone to snatch other people's credit and debit card data within seconds,"" said Disklabs boss Simon Steggles.
""These apps simply copy the card with all the information on it.""
His firm also designs ""faraday"" bags which block mobile signals. Such bags are often used by police now to store mobile phones taken from suspects.
Last month the BBC reported that several police forces around the country had admitted that some mobile phones confiscated from suspects had been remotely wiped because they had not been stored in a secure way.
Wearable hacks
Disklab's RFID-blocking wallet will go on sale in the new year
Ethical hacker Ken Munro is also acutely aware of the problem of RFID hacking. His firm, Pen Test Partners, has developed him a proof-of-concept RFID-blocking suit.
Made of cloth woven with metal fibres, the suit was not cheap to make but is washable.
""If we are not explicitly blocking these signals there are a lot of things that can go wrong, from stealing contactless payment card details to more life-threatening issues,"" he told the BBC.
He thinks the RFID jeans may not be a sufficient defence against hackers.
""The pockets are shielded but nothing else. Stuff in your pockets is easy to shield with a wallet or similar. Our suit is different - the entire thing is shielded.""
This becomes important as more and more RFID technology, such as wearable insulin pumps or in-chest monitoring devices, becomes standard, he said.
""These are the devices where tampering or hacking over radio frequency could be life-threatening,"" he said.
""I'm not sure that medical device manufacturers have given enough thought to security.""

Filmgoers in LA had some concerns but police said there was no cause for alarm
The New York premiere of The Interview, a comedy about the assassination of North Korea's president, has been cancelled amid threats from hackers.
A spokesman for the cinema chain due to host the screening said it had been shelved.
Hackers targeting Sony Pictures had threatened to attack US cinemas showing the studio's film.
They belong to the same group which has released emails and data stolen from Sony.
Calling themselves Guardians of Peace, the hackers mentioned the 9/11 attacks in a recent warning, claiming ""the world will be full of fear"".
""Remember the 11th of September 2001. We recommend you to keep yourself distant from the places at that time,"" the hacker group wrote in a message on Tuesday.
The Interview stars James Franco (left) and Seth Rogen
""If your house is nearby, you'd better leave,"" they add. ""Whatever comes in the coming days is called by the greed of Sony Pictures Entertainment.""
The Department of Homeland Security said there was ""no credible intelligence to indicate an active plot"" against cinemas, but noted it was still analysing messages from the group.
A spokesman for Landmark, the cinema chain due to host the New York premiere, confirmed the showing had been cancelled but gave no reason, Reuters news agency reported.
Executives from Sony had previously said they would not object if cinemas chose not to show The Interview.
Carmike Cinemas, which operates 278 venues across the country, has cancelled planned screenings, according to several news outlets.
Others have backed the movie. ""If they play it, we'll show it,"" said Tom Stephenson, CEO of Look Cinemas.
""Sony has a right to make the movie, we have a right to play it and censorship in general is a bad thing.""
The film's stars, James Franco and Seth Rogen, have also pulled out of several media appearances including appearances on the chat shows Late Night with Seth Meyers and The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon.
Embarrassing emails
Guardians of Peace have also released a new trove of Sony company data, calling it a ""Christmas gift"".
A cache of company emails, social security numbers and salary details had already been released.
On Tuesday, two former Sony Pictures employees sued the California company for not providing adequate security to prevent the computer breach.
The studio earlier attempted to limit the damage by contacting some US news outlets to block the publication of the emails.
Some of the emails released have contained embarrassing exchanges about some of Hollywood's biggest stars, among them Angelina Jolie and Leonardo DiCaprio.
Variety, the New York Times and the Hollywood Reporter were informed the studio ""does not consent to your possession... dissemination, publication... or making any use of the stolen information"".
North Korea has denied involvement in the attack, but has described it as a ""righteous deed"" that may have been carried out by its ""supporters and sympathisers"".
According to Variety's Andrew Wallenstein, however, publishing the stolen data is "" problematic but necessary "" because it ""is in the public domain"" and ""unavoidable"".

Website glitch reveals Apprentice finalists
Spoiler warning: This story contains details of this year's Apprentice finalists, which you may not wish to read.
This year's series began with 20 candidates, with Lord Sugar often firing more than one person per episode
'Bimbo, ball-breaker' or Lady Brady Watch
The finalists for this year's series of The Apprentice were apparently revealed before Wednesday's episode, due to a glitch on the show's website.
On Tuesday night, the BBC's "" meet the candidates "" page said three people remained in the process - despite five appearing in Wednesday's semi-final.
The site was later updated, restoring the contestants to ""un-fired"" status.
The BBC declined to comment on the website glitch. And, in the end, Lord Sugar only selected two finalists.
Among those leaving the show was bookmakers' favourite Roisin Hogan.
The 32-year-old chartered accountant from Ireland had impressed by inventing a successful, geography-based board game and convincing leading supermarkets to buy 25,500 tea-infused cheesecakes.
But her business plan - a low carbohydrate ready meal - failed to impress Lord Sugar and his advisers.
Roisin Hogan had kept a level head throughout the process, but fell at the final hurdle
Hogan said she did not regret giving up her job to take part in the TV show.
""I've taken Lord Sugar's advice on board, and his advisers' advice on board and I've scaled back my ambition somewhat,"" she said.
""I've partnered with a industry expert and we are going to bring the product to market hopefully in early 2015.""
Fumbled pitch
Solomon Akhtar was also dismissed from the boardroom, having submitted a flimsy business proposal that amounted to just eight pages - with pictures.
""I think I was too ambitious for Lord Sugar and too outgoing,"" said the 22-year-old, after being fired.
""He's not a fun person. He's very boring, he wears a suit, he's very money-orientated. He just doesn't get life.
""I think that's probably why I got shouted out of the room because I actually have a personality and I'm not boring.""
Pub quiz company director Daniel Lassman also left the competition, after suffering a series of blunders and awkward moments.
During the 10-week interview process, he drafted a set of baffling, misogynistic questions for a board game called The Relationship Guru and sabotaged the sale of a high-tech sweater by telling potential buyers: ""You wouldn't go in a public place with it.""
Bianca Miller and Mark Wright survived the semi-final
After getting the chop, he suggested he would be interested in taking part in other reality series.
""If it just so happens that a particular show puts up a lot of money for me to go on, we'll cross that bridge when I come to it.""
But he added: ""It's not something you go on to a show like this for. I think it's highly documented that I turned down an offer from Towie [The Only Way Is Essex] when I was younger. If I'd wanted to go down that route, I could have.""
The two remaining contestants are Bianca Miller, whose business proposal for Lord Sugar is a hosiery company for women with different skin tones.
Sales manager Mark Wright, whose plan is to launch a digital marketing company, is also in the running, having excelled at selling tasks during the TV show.
In one week, he sold seven hot tubs to a single customer - but he also fumbled a crucial sales pitch in the quarter-finals.
The pair are fighting for the chance to win a £250,000 investment.
The winner will be decided in the final episode on Sunday 21 December.

Rouble in free-fall despite rate rise
Technology giant Apple says it cannot sell products online in Russia because the rouble's value is too volatile for it to set prices.
The company stopped sales of its iPhones, iPads and other products in the country after a day in which the currency went into free-fall.
The rouble has lost more than 20% this week, despite a dramatic decision to raise interest rates from 10.5% to 17%.
Last Updated at 19 Dec 2014, 06:50 *Chart shows local time
$1 buys

+0.00
Its all time low, set on Wednesday, saw one dollar buying as many as 79 roubles.
Apple last month increased its prices in Russia by 20% after the weakening rouble left products in the country cheaper than in the rest of Europe.
Russia's central bank said on Wednesday it had spent almost $2bn intervening in the currency market on Monday.
It has spent around $80bn trying to prop up its rouble this year, but despite that, the currency has lost more than half its value against the dollar since January, with cheaper oil and Western sanctions over its stance over Ukraine the chief factors.
Both of these have weakened the Russian economy.
Russia's central bank has pledged fresh further measures to try to stabilise its currency, with First Deputy Governor Sergei Shvetsov describing the situation as ""critical"".
John Simpson asks if the currency crisis will affect Putin's popularity
The rouble's slide this week was prompted by fears that the US was considering a fresh set of sanctions against the country for its support for separatists in Ukraine.

The trial featured videotape testimony from the late Steve Jobs which had been recorded in 2011
Apple faces digital music trial
Apple has been found not guilty of engaging in anti-competitive behaviour by a jury in California.
The long-running suit focused on Apple's 2006 update to its iTunes software which meant only iPods could play music purchased from the store.
Consumers alleged this violated US antitrust laws, and sued for $350m (£222m) in damages.
The trial had featured emails sent by Apple founder Steve Jobs before his death in 2012.
The class action suit represented as many as 8 million iPod customers and 500 resellers, and could have cost Apple as much as $1bn, as anti-competition damage rewards are automatically tripled under US law.
'An issue'
Lawyers representing consumers and electronics retailers argued that Apple used its iTunes software to force buyers to use iPods instead of rival devices between 2006 and 2009. (The software was updated in 2009 to remove the restrictions.)
The lawyers argued this shut out other devices artificially inflated the price of iPods and used the emails from Mr Jobs to buttress this argument.
In one, sent in 2003, Mr Jobs worried about competition from Musicmatch, a software company, opening its own music store.
""We need to make sure that when Music Match launches their download music store they cannot use iPod,"" he wrote.
""Is this going to be an issue?""
However, the jurors sided with Apple, who argued the upgrade to its iTunes 7.0 software substantially improved the user experience, and thus was not subject to anti-competitive violations.
Earlier this year, Apple announced it would cease manufacturing the iPod Classic, one of the signature products that led Apple's revival under Mr Jobs.

By Zoe Kleinman Technology reporter, BBC News
Tech firms use data centres such as this all over the world to store customers' data
Microsoft must release overseas data
Apple and eBay are among those supporting Microsoft's stand against handing over data stored in Ireland to the US government.
One year ago, prosecutors issued a warrant for emails stored by Microsoft in an Irish data centre, in connection with a drug-related investigation.
The tech giant refused to comply but was ordered by a judge to hand over the information in July.
Microsoft has now filed letters of support from a large number of allies.
These include tech firms Verizon, Amazon, Cisco and HP, as well as trade associations such as the US Chamber of Commerce, and Digital Rights Ireland.
Various news organisations such as CNN, the Guardian and the Washington Post are on board along with computer scientists from universities across the US including Harvard, Stanford and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
Earlier this year, New York judge James Francis said that a warrant for online information was the equivalent of a subpoena and had to be obeyed.
Privacy rights
The firm and its supporters argue that the centre in Dublin is outside US jurisdiction, while the prosecutors claim that as the data itself is accessible by the firm from within the US, this does not apply.
""We believe that when one government wants to obtain email that is stored in another country, it needs to do so in a manner that respects existing domestic and international laws,"" wrote Microsoft's Brad Smith, general counsel and executive vice president of legal and corporate affairs, in a blog post .
""In contrast, the US government's unilateral use of a search warrant to reach email in another country puts both fundamental privacy rights and cordial international relations at risk.""

Google plans child-friendly products
Google has been threatened with a fine of up to 15m euros (£12m) if it does not do a better job of protecting the privacy of Dutch citizens.
The threat was made by the Dutch data protection agency (DPA), which said Google had broken local laws governing what it could do with user data.
The search giant has been given until the end of February 2015 to change the way it handles personal data.
Google said it was ""disappointed"" by the Dutch data watchdog's statement.
""This has been ongoing since 2012, and we hope our patience will no longer be tested,"" Dutch DPA chairman Jacob Kohnstamm told Reuters.
Privacy change
The row has blown up over the way that Google combines data about what people do online in order to tailor adverts to their preferences.
Information about keywords in search queries, email messages, cookies, location data and video viewing habits are all used by Google to build up a profile on each of its millions of users.
Dutch laws said Google should tell people about this data-gathering activity and get permission from them before it was combined or analysed, said Mr Kohnstamm.
A Google representative said ""We're disappointed with the Dutch data protection authority's order, especially as we have already made a number of changes to our privacy policy in response to their concerns.
""However, we've recently shared some proposals for further changes with the European privacy regulators group, and we look forward to discussing with them soon.""
The Dutch DPA was one of a group of six European data regulators that looked at Google following changes made in early 2012 to unify its privacy policies around the world.

They played a game called Mystery Skype where pupils from one school asked questions to try to work out which part of the world the other school was in.
The Skype Translator service is available in English and Spanish but Microsoft says it will eventually be available in more languages.
There are more than 40 instant messaging languages available to customers who have signed up via the Skype Translator page and are using Windows 8.1.
According to Microsoft more than 300 million people use Skype each month, totalling more than 2 billion minutes of conversation a day.

The World Cup in Brazil, Ebola and the iPhone 6 were the biggest Google trends in the UK in 2014.
The search engine has also revealed we asked ""Who is Banksy?"" and ""What is ALS?"" more than anything else.
The deaths of Peaches Geldof, Robin Williams and Rik Mayall also featured in the top 10 trending search list.
Flappy Bird, the Grand National and Jennifer Lawrence appeared in the top searches as well.
Ebola was the top news story of the year, followed by ALS - inspired by the ice bucket challenge which aimed to promote awareness of Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis - and Malaysia Airlines, which lost two passenger planes in separate incidents during 2014.
Luis Suarez's bite on Italian defender Giorgio Chiellini during the World Cup was fourth, with the Scottish Independence vote fifth.
Cliff Richard, the celebrity photo hack and Oscar Pistorius were also in the top 10.
Google is often used to answer questions, with the most common this year being ""Who is Banksy?""
That was followed by ""Who is Frenchy?"" - the Celebrity Big Brother star - with rapper Dappy, Palestinian group Hamas and Isis also appearing on the list.
Googlers in 2014 were also asking for tips on learning new skills, with the most popular being ""How to draw"", followed by ""How to kiss"" and ""How to crochet"".
Kissing was the most popular ""How To"" search in Newcastle, Leeds, Glasgow, Liverpool, Brighton, Nottingham, London and Edinburgh.
Finding out how to meditate, knit, twerk and squat were also among the most popular things Google users wanted to know.
While there were a host of celebrity deaths in 2014, the loss of Peaches Geldof was the most searched for, followed by Robin Williams and Rik Mayall.
Beyonce topped the most searched female celebrity list, beating the likes of Jennifer Lawrence and Katy Perry to the number one spot.
Pop star Ariana Grande topped the rising female celebrity list, with British vlogger Zoella also making it into the top five.
Ed Sheeran tops the male celebrity list with fellow singer Pharrell sitting at the top of the rising list, with Sherlock star Benedict Cumberbatch second.
In sport, there was something of a surprise as Hull City were the fourth most searched for Premier League team, ahead of both Chelsea and Manchester City.
Liverpool topped that particular table ahead of Manchester United, with Arsenal in third.
Michael Schumacher was the top sportsperson search of the year as Google users looked up how the seven-time Formula 1 world champion continued his recovery from a skiing accident.

"145","Sony Pictures hack - whodunnit?","Is North Korea the most obvious suspect?","Whodunnit? The Mystery of the Sony Pictures Hack
By Jane Wakefield Technology reporter
Sony Pictures computer system hacked
It has become the whodunnit that is gripping Hollywood without a penny being spent on production.
Now The Mystery of the Sony Pictures Hack - which already had all the ingredients for a major Hollywood film - has taken a new twist as the movie at the heart of the row is pulled.
That raises a whole host of questions but the key one - who was behind the attack - remains unanswered.
To help get to the bottom of the mystery, the BBC turned detective and considered the evidence.
What we know so far:
What isn't in doubt, despite Sony's desire to write a script where it wakes up and it was all a bad dream, is that the film giant's internal computer system was hacked in November.
The group responsible called itself The Guardians of Peace and warned that if its demands were not met, secret data would be ""shown to the world"". Crucially though it did not outline its demands.
A number of as-yet unreleased films popped up on online download sites. The Interview, a comedy featuring a plot to assassinate North Korea's leader Kim Jong-un, was not among those released.
The hackers also released the salary and social security numbers of thousands of Sony employees - including celebrities.
Following threats of 9/11 style incidents at any cinema that screened the film from the group behind the hack, Sony announced that it was cancelling the release of the movie altogether.
Who are the prime suspects?
A nation state, most likely North Korea
Supporters of North Korean regime, based in China
Hackers with a money-making motive
Hackers or a lone individual with another motive, such as revenge
The case for North Korea:
The leadership made no secret of its anger at the imminent release of The Interview
The case for North Korea being behind the attack seems, at least on the face of it, to be a compelling one.
It has a motive and a history of hacking.
Its leadership certainly did not disguise its anger about the forthcoming Sony film The Interview.
In fact, it described the film as ""an act of terrorism"".
And rather like a robbery being pinned on a local criminal who has a history of similar offences, North Korea has form.
Many are pointing the finger of suspicion firmly towards the crime Unit 121 of North Korea's General Bureau of Reconnaissance, described by some commentators as the country's most elite hacking unit.
And shortly after news that the film was pulled, the New York Times ran an article quoting an unnamed government source as saying it believed that attack to be state-sponsored with the North Korean government involved.
The case against:
Who else might be to blame?
It might not be the most compelling evidence but it is worth noting that  North Korea denied that it was behind the attack, saying instead that it was the work of someone sympathetic to its cause. It hardly ever bothers to deny such claims.
North Korea is not averse to a bit of hacking but many say that the history of this particular crime does not fit with its modus operandus.
Its usual target is South Korea where attacks such as one launched in March 2013 have taken down internal networks.
Blogger Marc Rogers drills down into the details of this particular hack.
He concludes that the fact that the code was written on a PC with Korean locale and language actually makes it less likely North Korea is the source.
He points out that they do not speak traditional Korean in North Korea, they speak their own dialect and traditional Korean is forbidden.
""Let's not forget also that it is trivial to change the language/locale of a computer before compiling code on it,"" he writes.
He also points out that the the hackers are very net and social-media savvy. ""That and the sophistication of the operation, do not match with the profile of the DPRK (Democratic People's Republic of Korea).""
But perhaps his most compelling piece of evidence is the fact that the attackers only latched onto The Interview connection after the media suggested that North Korea might be linked to the attack.
So if not North Korea then who?
Who else would have a motive for the attack?
In his blog, Mr Rogers writes ""I would find the presence of Chinese far more plausible"" and others also think that Chinese hackers, possibly recruited by North Korea, are a far more likely source of the malware.
Other think it may be hackers out to make some money.
When the hack was first reported there was little to suggest a monetary motive but actually the hackers emailed five top Sony Pictures executives on November 21, days before they began leaking the files, and demanded money.
Sean Sullivan, a senior researcher at security company F-Secure, believes extortion could be the motive behind the hack.
""That is a lot more credible than a nation state,"" he told the BBC.
For him, the real test will  be what the hackers do next.
If the pulling of The Interview was their primary motive, things should quieten down but if there are more data dumps, then he thinks everyone should pretty much dismiss North Korea as the source.
""I would even bet they dump The Interview on to a torrent site unless Sony puts some money in a brown paper bag,"" he said.
Like Mr Rogers, he does not rule out the involvement of Chinese hackers.
""It is far more likely that North Korea would have recruited Chinese hackers who both wanted to make some money and cause Sony pain,"" he said.
If the sorry tale were to be turned into a Hollywood movie and, given the times we live in, it almost certainly will - although probably not made by Sony - a better plotline might be anonymous hackers intent on revenge.
To understand how this might be a possibility requires a bit of a trawl through the history of Sony and hacking.
Its battle with hackers began in 2005 when its music division installed software which modified computer operating systems to prevent CDs being copied. It continued in 2010 when Sony took on teenaged hacker George Hotz who jailbroke his PlayStation 3 and released the code.
Its most high-profile attack happened in April 2011 when hacking group Anonymous launched a campaign to bring down the PlayStation Network. The attackers gaining access to the personal information of more than 77 million users. The hack cost Sony at least $171m.
As Chester Wisniewski, a senior security adviser at Sophos, put it in an interview with Gizmodo . ""Sony's been raising the ire of hackers for as long as I can remember, so you have to think that they've known they're a serious target.""
For Mr Roberts, the most obvious suspect, like many of the best whodunnits, may be far closer to home.
""My money is on a disgruntled (possibly ex) employee of Sony,"" he concludes.
Will the case ever make it to court?
It is debatable whether those responsible for the attack will ever be brought to justice. The US government has said that, if the hackers do turn out to be North Korean, it will be very difficult to prosecute them.
And while many may speculate on other suspects, hard evidence is proving elusive.
""The jury is out - North Korea is definitely a suspect. It had opportunity and the means but to convict them you need more evidence,"" said security expert from the University of Surrey Prof Alan Woodward.
What everyone does agrees is that the ripple effects from the attack will be felt long after the commentators have stopped asking who is to blame.
Sony Pictures faces a long road to redeeming its reputation and gaining back the trust of Hollywood.
America faces the hardest of questions about whether, by withdrawing the film, is has given into threats in a way it usually refuses to do.
And the IT bosses of corporations around the world may just as well cancel all their Christmas leave as chief executives demand immediate reviews of their security procedures in a desperate attempt to make sure they never fall foul of similar embarrassing leaks.
For Mr Sullivan the hack represents a good moment for corporate America to scrutinise its security arrangements. While it might seem easy to blame a nation state it is time to sit up and acknowledge that this could have happened to any number of firms.
He hopes there will be "" a decent post-mortem"".
Until then though The Most Mysterious Case of the Sony Hack will remain like Charles Dickens' final novel - The Mystery of Edwin Drood - unfinished.

"146","Social shopping takes off in Asia","The latest trend driving Asian spending sprees","Asians flock to social networks for shopping sprees
By Rajeshni Naidu-Ghelani Business Reporter, BBC News, Singapore
Dora's become a fashion icon in Singapore influencing young women's shopping habits
Cashless in Cape Town
Singaporean student Dora Soh posts her ""outfit of the day"" online every day, to connect with fellow fashionistas and inspire her nearly 10,000 followers on Instagram.
The 22-year-old's shopping habits have become so influential that online retailers are now sponsoring her to wear their clothes, in hopes that her posts will boost their brand and sales.
Online retailers sponsoring Dora include Singaporean brands The Tinsel Rack, MGP and Mint & Ooak
""On social media, I can interact with strangers and share fashion inspiration by following their accounts and liking their photos,"" Ms Soh says.
While this sounds like a simple formula to keep up with the latest fashion trends, the avid shopper is at the forefront of a rapidly growing business in Asia - social shopping.
Global retailers are pulling out all the stops to increase their presence on social networks with technology that allows you to broadcast your latest fashion find online, even before it rings through the register.
For example, on Singapore-based social network and shopping website clozette.co , users can upload a picture of an item, or focus in on someone else's post, and hit search to find similar outfits for sale.
It is as exact as narrowing in on nail art on someone's finger nails, to search on the website's database of two million items from nearly 5,000 global brands.
""I truly believe we're the first company in the world to do that - intelligent visual recognition,"" says the website's co-founder and chief executive Roger Yuen.
Social platforms take off
Mr Yuen says growth has skyrocketed on his social media platform, which allows users to create and share their personal wardrobes, as well as buy and sell items from each other and retailers in Asia.
""We have close to 400,000 registered members in the region, and as a company we have a reach of about seven million unique users a month,"" he says.
The firm launched in 2010 with just under 80,000 users in its first year.
Users can create their own virtual wardrobes or raid through others' to find the latest fashion trends
Singapore based beauty box start-up Vanitytrove.com/sg has also seen tremendous growth since it launched its user content-driven platform earlier this year.
Co-founder and chief executive Douglas Gan says about 100-150 new members join the website every day, to browse or post about new products, and chat with like-minded beauty experts.
""We have over 60,000 female members on the platform in Singapore, Indonesia and Thailand,"" he says. ""We figured that if we want consumers to make a conscious decision before they buy something, we should give them a platform.""
Users share makeup tips and beauty product must-haves on Vanitytrove
'Word of mouth'
Rapid growth for such fashion-based social networks is not surprising considering recent figures that showed more and more Asians are turning to social media to shape their shopping habits, outpacing other regions of the world.
In a study of 10,000 consumers worldwide, consulting firm AT Kearney found over 95% of people aged between 16 and 45 in China said the chatter on social networks has at some point influenced their online shopping decisions.
Meanwhile, 61% of Chinese respondents said they ""frequently"" based purchases on what was happening in their social network - almost double the global average of 32%.
In consumer giant India, over 82% of people aged 16-35 said happenings on their social network influenced their buying habits.
Even among the older generation - those aged 65 and over - more than a quarter said their purchases were frequently influenced by social media - much higher than the global average of 5% for that age group.
Figures suggest people in Asia use social media to help them decide what to buy more than anywhere else
Torsten Stocker, Shanghai-based partner at AT Kearney, says word of mouth referrals is the major reason why more Asians rely on social media for shopping, in a world of fake goods and knock-offs.
""There's obviously a history of information control, particularly in China, and I think that extends to some extent to advertising,"" he says.
""I think there's also a high prevalence of counterfeit, fake and low quality goods - so that it automatically reduces the trust people have in official communication.""
Trusting someone who has your best interests in mind, like a close friend or acquaintance, or even someone that is slightly more removed but in your network, is much more compelling, he adds
""If you look at China in particular, there's been so many food scandals, and so many items that may be counterfeit, and may not deliver what they promise. In general the level of trust [in retailers] is lower.""
Asian consumers look for reassurance when shopping to ensure they are getting authentic merchandise
Retailers' virtual push
As a result, a lot of consumer goods companies and retailers in Asia are trying to engage with consumers through social media, and create word of mouth in the virtual world.
Retailers that have been successful in creating a buzz online are using a range of tactics from promising shoppers discounts if they post ""selfies"" wearing their merchandise, to creating online communities based on competitions or events.
Outdoor clothing outlet The North Face's strategy in China this year gained momentum after it launched a competition for consumers to be ""The Next Explorer"", and win a trip to the US.
The competition resulted in more than 200,000 new members to its online community, where participants talk about products and connect with each other to organise events such as hiking trips.
Members post about adventure trips they have taken on The North Face Chinese website
""It has taken on a life of its own. North Face is behind it, but it's not necessarily advertising for its products,"" says Mr Stocker.
""It's made them more visible, and helped create more interest in the category... and hopefully people will buy more products.""
The North Face sales in China jumped more than 20% in 2013 from the year before.
Meanwhile, as retailers try to come up with innovative ways to engage with consumers online, Singaporean online shopper Chelsea Lin says that overall, it is just easier to get more feedback on purchases through social networks versus going into a physical store.
""It becomes quite addictive, to the point where it's a weekly thing that I would buy something,"" the 30-year-old office worker says.
""It's like you can shop everyday if you shop online.""

"147","A guide to the Sony Pictures hack","What we know about the devastating hack that hit Sony","The Interview: A guide to the cyber attack on Hollywood
Sony film The Interview has featured highly in hackers' demands
A month after hackers launched an attack on Sony Pictures, the fallout has led the Hollywood studio to cancel the release of satirical comedy The Interview, which involves a plot to assassinate North Korean leader Kim Jong-un.
The initial hack, which exposed embarrassing emails and personal details about some of the world's biggest movie stars, has escalated after the supposed hackers made threats against cinemas showing the film.
It is turning into one of  the most difficult and damaging episodes in recent Hollywood history. Here, we examine the complicated catalogue of events.
How did it start?
On November 22, there were signs that Sony's computer system had been compromised when skulls appeared on employees' screens with a message threatening to expose ""secrets"" from data obtained in a sophisticated hack.
This initially caused crippling computer problems for workers at Sony, who were forced to work with pen and paper. ""We even fired up our fax machine,"" one employee told the LA Times.
Sony initially said they were dealing with an ""IT matter"", but later acknowledged the hack to staff, calling it a ""brazen attack"" comprised of ""malicious criminal acts"".
Who is responsible?
North Korean TV denied involvement in the cyber attack
A unknown group calling itself #GOP - later identified as Guardians of Peace - claimed it was behind the cyber attack , prompting the FBI to launch an investigation. Their name has been attached to subsequent leaks of information.
Speculation has since mounted that North Korea may have had a hand in the attack as a form of retaliation for Sony's release of The Interview.
A North Korean foreign ministry spokesman called the movie an ""act of terrorism"" in June , promising ""merciless"" retaliation if it was released.
The country eventually denied involvement, but heaped praise on the hack, calling it a ""righteous deed"". The secretive nation's ability to wage cyber warfare is not unknown, but it has not previously used the name Guardians of Peace.
News network Bloomberg has reported that the perpetrators worked from a hotel in Thailand, while unnamed Sony executives told TMZ the hackers were helped by insiders who knew where the most embarrassing information could be found. US media quoted anonymous officials as saying that the FBI had linked North Korea to the attacks.
Why was the release of The Interview pulled?
Hackers have warned cinemas against screening The Interview
The fallout from the hack escalated after the ""Guardians of Peace"" claimed they would attack cinemas showing the Sony film. They alluded to 9/11 in their message and said it was a response to the ""greed of Sony Pictures"".
The film's New York premiere was cancelled and cinema chains cancelled screenings, leading Sony to announce that it had ""decided not to move forward with the planned December 25 theatrical release"".
However the decision has been greeted with incredulity by some in Hollywood.
""Wow. Everyone caved,"" actor Rob Lowe wrote on Twitter . ""The hackers won. An utter and complete victory for them. Wow.""
Comedian Jimmy Kimmel tweeted that the decision by theatres to refuse to show the film was ""an un-American act of cowardice that validates terrorist actions and sets a terrifying precedent.""
What did the hackers steal?
Annie - starring Cameron Diaz - has been leaked as a result of the hack
Before the controversy around The Interview, reams of data considered confidential by Sony - and some of the company's prime assets - were stolen in the hack.
An early version of a script for the next James Bond movie, Spectre, was leaked but failed to halt production.
Five Sony films, including the new and unreleased version of Annie, turned up on illegal file-sharing sites and were downloaded up to a million times. Brad Pitt's Fury, which had already hit cinema screens, was also shared.
What information has been revealed?
A whole host of Sony's private company information has apparently been exposed to the public, including bosses' salaries and employees' social security information.
Strings of confidential emails between Sony workers have also been circulated and proved to be the most sensitive and embarrassing leaks.
The emails revealed that:
Female film stars including Amy Adams and Jennifer Lawrence were paid less than their male co-stars.
Sony executive Amy Pascal made jokes about black-themed movies that might be among President Obama's favourites.
Angelina Jolie was branded a ""minimally talented spoiled brat"" in a private email from producer Scott Rudin.
George Clooney lost sleep over bad reviews for The Monuments Men and emailed Pascal to say: ""I've let you all down. Not my intention. I apologize. I've just lost touch… Who knew?""
Sony has contacted some media outlets asking them to exercise caution over the leaked material they report on.
How did Hollywood respond?
Oscar winner Aaron Sorkin has railed against the fall-out of the hack
A-listers at the heart of the revelations have maintained a dignified silence.
But screenwriter and producer Aaron Sorkin wrote in the New York Times of his anger at the hack, accusing the media of aiding and abetting the cyber criminals by sifting through the leaked information and reporting the most salacious findings. He hit out at Hollywood for doing little to protect the dignity of Sony employees, whose personal data has been stolen.
James Franco and Seth Rogen, stars of The Interview, have also commented publicly on the hack, using colourful language on US ""shock jock"" Howard Stern's show to refer to the ""stolen information"", adding that its circulation is ""doing exactly what these criminals want"".

Quantum physics is weird. Things can be in two places at once or spinning in two different directions at the same time.
We can normally ignore this absurdity since  it only happens at the microscopic scale.  However, soon machines  that exploit these bizarre features could revolutionise computing.
Conventional computers store and process information as bits. A bit can be a 1 or a 0. A modern computer chip  has millions (even billions) of electronic switches that can either be on to represent 1 or off to represent 0. The progress in computing over the past 70 years has been to shrink and speed up these switches.
The Colossus was the first electronic computer - these are valves from a recreation of the 1944 version
A quantum computer works very differently. Because it uses as its bits tiny particles , either atoms or subatomic particles, these are subject to the laws of quantum physics.
That means they can be in two states at the same time, so a quantum bit (or qbit) can be a 1 or a 0 or a 1 and a 0 at the same time.  I will say that again.  A qbit can be both a 1 and a zero at the same time.
So why might this revolutionise computing?
For all their amazing performance, conventional computers have their limitations. There are some problems so difficult that all the computers that have ever been built could work together and still not find the answer before the sun explodes.
Optimization
As a simple example of the sort of problem we are talking about,  imagine a travelling sales representative.  He or she has to go to 10 different locations in a day and wants to work out which is the most efficient order to make the visits.
This is actually a huge mathematical problem, with more than 3.5 million possible combinations that each has to be worked out before the best solution can be reached. Increase the number of locations from 10 to 20 and there are more than two quintillion possible solutions (that's 2 followed by 18 zeros).
Now consider not cities, but stars.  There are 300 billion solar systems in our galaxy.  No surprise then that Nasa is very interested in quantum computing.
This is an example of what's called an optimization problem and our world is awash with them.  From designing the right formula for a new drug to trying to get machines to think like humans.
A quantum computer could crunch this sort of problem pretty swiftly because its qbits are able to consider all the possible answers at the same time and then pick the best answer.
A D-Wave machine has been installed at Nasa Ames Research Center in California
So how close are we to real quantum computers? Canadian company D-Wave will sell you one now.  Although there is a lively debate among physicists as to whether the D-wave machine is really a quantum computer. (That debate is too technical and complex to even attempt to summarise here).
Closer to home, researchers at Oxford University have succeeded in controlling charged calcium atoms (ions) in a quantum state. At the moment, the apparatus to do this fills a basement.
Shrink this down and add a million or two more qbits and they will have a quantum computer. That, they say, is probably a decade or more away. The physicists involved in this work are very obviously excited to be at the start of a science that could fundamentally change our world.

Does art make financial sense?
Every year in December, Miami Beach becomes the epicentre of the art world. Tens of thousands of people flock to Art Basel where sales of art reportedly top $3bn (£1.9bn).
In the hyper-party atmosphere billionaires rub shoulders with struggling artists and serious collectors vie with amateurs to spot a potential masterpiece. Thanks to the internet, art has never been more accessible and new markets are opening up around the world.
""China is a really exciting opportunity for us,"" says Carter Cleveland, the 28-year-old founder of Artsy, an online database featuring works by 25,000 artists and more than 2,000 galleries around the world.
Officially launched in 2012, Artsy has attracted $26m in funding and has some big name backers such as Paypal cofounder Peter Thiel. The site makes money by charging galleries a monthly subscription to list their art.

The company has an office in Hong Kong but has yet to establish a presence in mainland China. In an effort to make contacts and pave the way for expansion, Artsy hosted a celebrity bash where the star of the party was Chinese choreographer and artist Shen Wei.
""China is a lot more challenging because they have their own infrastructure and their own social media and their own search engines,"" says Cleveland. ""So when you want to expand into mainland China it takes a much more thoughtful approach.""
China's contemporary art market didn't exist much before 2000. It has now overtaken the US, according to Berlin-based Artnet, another online platform that specialises in art auctions. In fact, growth in China appears to be driving the global art industry, which is worth an estimated $66bn.
Underscoring the boom in sales, several Chinese galleries staged exhibitions at Art Basel in Miami Beach, including newcomer Beijing Commune. Director Lu Jingjing says the gallery is considering joining Artsy but is still weighing the benefits.
""Search engines are very well developed too so you have to measure whether it's worth the investment,"" she says.
Beijing Commune currently uses WeChat - a mobile messaging app that has 438 million users, mainly in China.
Beijing Commune director Lu Jingjing is currently weighing her options as to what platforms she uses
""It's not a selling tool like Artsy or Artnet. But you can make your own newsletter about your exhibitions and you know how many people have read it,"" says Lu Jingjing.
Hsinke Lee is head of exhibitions at Long March Space, another Chinese gallery at Art Basel. She thinks digital platforms are a ""positive"" development and predicts they will have a greater role in the Chinese art market.
She says many people already buy most things through Taobao, the Chinese equivalent of Amazon, and art is no different.
""I've noticed a lot of collectors purchase works without viewing them first in person. I myself have clients like that. Even when the work is worth close to a million dollars, they don't need to see it,"" she says.
Rhonda Long-Sharp learnt from her own experience of buying a Picasso online that turned out to be a fake
But the international art market is largely unregulated and other experts warn that buying online poses hazards for the unwary.
""You're only as safe and secure as the ethics of the particular dealer you're dealing with,"" says Rhonda Long-Sharp, a former lawyer who now owns an eponymous gallery in Indianapolis. She was exhibiting at Scope, another art fair timed to coincide with Art Basel in Miami Beach. Ironically, she switched careers after buying a fake Picasso online.
""From that I learned a great deal about the art market and the art world,"" she says.""When a collector looks online and says he wants a Warhol, he's going to find hundreds of galleries that purport to handle Warhol.
""But you don't know if they're a legitimate gallery, you don't know if the piece is authentic and you don't know if the condition is outstanding or if it's been restored so much that the value is really a smidgen of what it should be.""
Nevertheless, she pays Artnet ""a fair amount of money"" for a gallery page. She says it is an important marketing tool for Long-Sharp Gallery and good for collectors who want to learn more about a piece.
""Online impacts fairs like this because if you see something here that you like you can go online and look at other works by the artist. People often come here with their cameras, snap a shot of the piece and snap a shot of the name tag. You'll hear from them maybe two months later.""
Far from competing with physical fairs such as Art Basel, digital and social media have become an integral part of the event. In addition to 73,000 visitors, Art Basel Miami has 300,000 Facebook followers, 150,000 Twitter followers and 100,000 on Instagram.
Organisers also tapped into that online community to launch a crowdfunding campaign for non-profit art organisations that generally don't attract major investment but are seen as essential incubators for emerging talent.
Big businesses are also entering the digital art world. The Swiss bank UBS, a major sponsor of Art Basel, hopes to meet the surging demand for information with the launch of Planet Art, an app that aggregates news about contemporary art.
Peter Dillon, head of global art platforms at UBS, says it cuts through the clutter in a complicated market. ""It expands access to the art world and the art market. For somebody who is new to it, this is a great way to get real-time information,"" he says.
""It's data led so it's objective. It's based on an algorithm that uses the facts in articles to index and organise them. It's applying a skill set that we have as a bank to the art world.""
But although UBS has a massive corporate art collection, Dillon says the bank does not advise clients on buying art as an investment. A sentiment echoed by Art Basel director Marc Spiegler.
""The whole issue of art as an investment makes me somewhat queasy,"" he says. ""A lot of people have tried to do art funds, almost all of them have failed. Historically the collections that appreciated the most are the ones that went against the market. There is always a speculative market, there's always a bubble - but it's small.
""Our fair is not about monetising mini-bubbles; our fair is about building a sustainable support base for the careers of artists and their galleries. I think people should buy work that they like.""

"151","Thwarting retail's 'returnaholics'","The tech thwarting shopping's ""returnaholics""","Taking stock: Tech to thwart retail's worst miscreants
By Ian Hardy Technology reporter, New York
Rebecca Minkoff is a very busy woman. And like all successful fashion designers she likes to be at least a few steps ahead of the rest of us.
Christmas shopping gets tech boost
So it's not surprising her first flagship store - in the heart of Soho, New York City - is a cleverly concealed mix of bricks and bandwidth.
A partnership with eBay means that shoppers can log on in the shop via a giant interactive screen, to make a wish list of items.
Once in the changing room, the shopper can also communicate digitally with tablet-carrying sales associates, who then bring over requested clothes in different sizes and colours.
Once a decision has been made the guest can then pay for merchandise without ever standing in a queue or seeing a cash register.
Rebecca loves the idea of providing her customers with a physical shopping experience that brings with it all the best bits from an online world that her younger customers crave.
But as it turns out her new way of doing business might also help solve a major problem that plagues a lot of high street business owners - theft.
The high tech fitting rooms serving clients at Rebecca Minkoff's New York boutique
Sales assistants can check stock status from their tablets while on the shop floor
Tag it
To enable the customer care aspect of her boutique, every item has an RFID (radio frequency identification) chip embedded in the price tag.
So the in-store system can track the location of every shoe, skirt and handbag within the four walls, including the row of changing rooms which have been painted with a special surface to prevent radio signals becoming cross contaminated.
Of course, currently anyone can decapitate a tag in seconds, but Ms Minkoff says the shop is just one step away from a foolproof method of preventing ""shrinkage"",  as the loss of products is known in retailing.
""Today, they could [walk out of the door with the item] because there is a [removable] tag on this, but our next goal once a back end issue is solved, is embedding them in the clothes, bags and shoes and it will become a security device,"" she says.
Each price tag has an RFID tag embedded in it, making the items easy to track
Rebecca Minkoff in her New York shop
Another problem in the fashion world and retailing as a whole is fraudulent returns.
Only 1% of shoppers do it, but it added up to $16.3bn in the US alone in 2013 according to the National Retail Federation (NRF). And it's getting worse.
One trick known as ""wardrobing"", played out countless times especially around this time of year, is to buy a cocktail dress, wear it once, look absolutely stunning for a couple of hours, then return it the next day.
So now lots of shops put the tag in a prominent position on the garment that's super inconvenient for anyone to hide when taking the dress to a one-and-done style event.
Managers are also getting stricter about their return policies. Accidentally rip the tag off or lose the receipt? Too bad.
We are watching
That of course is a pretty low tech solution.
That's where The Retail Equation (TRE) comes in.
It is not an organisation that US shoppers know much about, except maybe ""returnaholics"", and its clients are kept top secret.
But the way it works is that a network of shops share information about people who mimic the behaviour of ""serial returners"".
These are people who may, for example, buy a top-of-the-line TV just before the Superbowl and keep it for less than 24 hours every year.
Buying a high-end TV the day before the Superbowl and returning within 24 hours is seen as suspicious
The information collected from individuals may vary from state to state, and the return policies differ from shop to shop, so a sophisticated algorithm is needed to identify possible abuses.
Tom Rittman, vice president of marketing for The Retail Equation, points out that a refused return is therefore an objective result made by a computer, allowing even the most subjective cashier to be removed from the decision making process.
""The factors that Verify-3 (the name of the system) may use for a given retailer include the frequency of returns, return dollar amounts, whether the return is receipted or non-receipted and purchase history,"" he says.
""Verify does not use other factors in authorising returns such as age, gender, race, nationality, physical characteristics or marital status.""
Faking it
Another enterprise where a complete crackdown has long seemed elusive is the art of counterfeiting.
But in a few years it's possible that many products, especially high end ones, will feature a logo or pattern created using nanotechnology.
The particles that make up the patterns are held in place by the surface tension of water
The images are made up of thousands and thousands of tiny dots
Fluorescent spheres which give out red, blue and green light can also be used to create patterns
The result is impossible to see with the naked eye, as it's a tiny fraction of the size of a pin head.
The logo or design is stamped onto a surface such as paper, glass, metal or precious stones in such a way that particles are held in place by the natural surface tension of water.
Dr Heiko Wolf at IBM Research in Zurich
Fluorescent spheres which give out red, blue and green light can also be used to create patterns.
Dr Heiko Wolf, a physicist at IBM Research in Zurich, claims it would be daunting for even the cleverest counterfeiter to replicate the technology.
That pleases many high end manufacturers, who are constantly on the look out for ways to hold on to their intellectual property.
""Yes, several have been in touch, in most cases they need the technique to print faster, which requires more research and investment,"" he says.
""The other challenge for them is how they can read the nano patterns at a retail location or at customs controls, so they would need to invest in optical detection instruments.""
Some companies have high hopes for the technology after seeing 3D holograms and an endless array of other anti counterfeit measures beaten over time.

Gandhi resumes work after surgery
Leader of India's main opposition Congress party Sonia Gandhi is in hospital for treatment of an infection.
Mrs Gandhi was admitted to Delhi's Ganga Ram Hospital on Friday evening, Press Trust of India news agency quoted party spokesman Ajay Maken as saying.
In 2011 Mrs Gandhi went to the US to receive surgery for an undisclosed medical condition.
Last year, she was taken to a Delhi hospital for a few hours after she fell ill during a debate in the parliament.
Mrs Gandhi was suffering from a respiratory tract infection and her condition is now stable, party officials said.
""She is currently under observation,"" a Congress spokesman told AFP news agency.
Mrs Gandhi, 68, is the widow of former prime minister Rajiv Gandhi.
She is the head of the Nehru-Gandhi dynasty, which has ruled India for most of the time since independence in 1947.
Her party lost the 2014 general elections to the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party.

The attacks in Mumbai lasted almost 60 hours, and saw numerous public buildings and locations attacked.
US bounty for Pakistan hardliner
A man accused of masterminding the 2008 Mumbai terror attacks has been granted bail by a court in Pakistan.
Zaki-ur-Rehman Lakhvi is one of seven men facing trial over the attacks in the Indian city, which left 165 people dead. Nine gunmen were also killed.
The attacks in Mumbai damaged peace efforts between India and Pakistan.
The bailing of Mr Lakhvi came a day after Pakistan PM Nawaz Sharif vowed to end terrorism after the Taliban killed 141 people at a school in Peshawar.
Correspondents say the move will be an embarrassment for the Pakistani authorities who are under pressure to bring suspects in the case to justice.
Zaki-ur-Rehman Lakhvi and his co-accused were arrested in 2008 and had filed bail applications on 10 December.
It remains unclear on what grounds the court ordered Mr Lakhvi's bail.
The attacks in Mumbai were blamed on the militant group Lashkar-e-Taiba, and Mr Lakhvi was accused of heading the group.
Another man, Zarar Shah, has been accused of working with him, and was arrested in Pakistani-administered Kashmir in December 2008, but his name does not appear alongside those being tried with Mr Lakhvi.
Nine other men have been also charged in absentia in relation to the attacks.
Mr Lakhvi has been in Pakistani custody since 2008.
Mr Lakhvi was directed to pay surety bonds worth 1m rupees (£6,400) before being released, his lawyer told  Reuters.
The lawyer, Raja Rizwan Abbasi, told the PTI news agency that bail had been granted because the ""evidence against Lakhvi was deficient"".
Prosecutors are considering whether to challenge the ruling.
India, which provided intelligence intercepts which it said proved Laskhar-e Taiba's involvement in the attack, was swift to criticise Mr Lakhvi's release.
Home Minister Rajnath Singh described the granting of bail as ""very unfortunate"".
He said: ""I believe it should not have happened... [The] Pakistan government must appeal against the order at the earliest.""
Correspondents say the charges brought against Mr Lakhvi and other suspects held in Pakistan were mainly based on a confession given by the only gunman captured alive after the attacks.
Mohammad Ajmal Amir Qasab was executed in 2012.

India launches cryogenic rocket Watch
India has successfully launched its largest rocket and an unmanned capsule which could send astronauts into space.
The 630-tonne Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle (MK III) blasted off from Sriharikota in the southern state of Andhra Pradesh on Thursday morning.
The new rocket will be able to carry heavier satellites into space.
India has successfully launched lighter satellites in recent years, but has faced problems sending up heavier payloads.
The new rocket is capable of carrying communication satellites weighing 4,000kg, reports say, meaning India will not have to rely on foreign launchers to do so.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi tweeted after the launch: ""Successful launch of GSLV MK-III is yet another triumph of brilliance & hard work of our scientists. Congrats to them for the efforts.""
K Radhakrishnan, chairman of the Indian Space and Research Organization (Isro), said the launch marked a ""very significant day in India's space history"".
The rocket's main cargo was an Indian-made capsule capable of carrying two to three astronauts into space.
Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle (MK III) is India's heaviest rocket
Isro said the capsule has ""safely splashed down into Bay of Bengal off Andaman and Nicobar Islands"" and that the experiment was successful.
Isro has sought funding from the government to send its astronauts into space and the successful launch could be the first step towards boosting its claim, correspondents say.
India is emerging as a major player in the multi-billion dollar space market and has undertaken several missions.
In September, it successfully put a satellite into orbit around Mars, becoming the fourth nation or geo-bloc to do so.

By Ashraf Padanna Trivandrum
How Vedanta's mine hope rests on 12 tribal villages
Tribespeople in the southern Indian state of Kerala have ended a 'standing protest' after the government acceded to their demands
They had been standing outside a government office since 9 July to press their claim for land and amenities.
They were demanding that the government deliver on its promise of giving land, water and electricity to the community.
Tribespeople comprise nearly 500,000 of Kerala's 33 million people and are mostly landless and desperately poor.
The protesters, who had travelled to the capital, Trivandrum, from their faraway villages would stand uninterruptedly for nearly 11 hours every day outside the main government office.
They blamed the authorities for failing to keep their promise of providing them land and amenities agreed with a previous government in 2001.
The government says it has so far been able to provide more than 9,000 acres of land to 6,887 families.
But the protesters say the number of landless tribal families has now grown to about 75,000 - up from 35,000 during the 2001 protest.
Kerala Chief Minister Oommen Chandy said on Thursday that landless families would be ""immediately"" allocated more than 19,000 acres of land for their rehabilitation.
The remaining families would get land as soon as more cultivable land becomes available to the government, he said.
""This will go a long way in protecting their land and ensure their right to live in dignity,"" Mr Chandy said.
Protest leader CK Janu said the government had agreed to ""100% of our demands"", which would ""ensure rights of livelihood and dignity of nearly half a million tribespeople"" in Kerala.
""This is a historic win for our long struggle for land and self-rule,"" she added.

India plane hits buffalo on take-off
India's troubled airline SpiceJet has resumed flights after it agreed to pay oil companies cash for fuel purchases.
The fleet of the debt-ridden carrier, which owes money to creditors, including oil companies, was grounded for several hours on Wednesday.
The cancellations left thousand of angry travellers stranded at airports across the country.
SpiceJet, India's fourth-biggest airline by market share, has $314m (£200m) in debts.
The company has been unable to pay its dues to staff, airports, tax authorities and its lenders.
""We have resumed operations [from Wednesday evening]. We paid [oil companies] in cash at some airports,"" news agency AFP quoted a source in SpiceJet as saying.
The airline cancelled nearly 1,900 flights last week and on Wednesday, it did not operate more than 150 of the 243 scheduled flights, reports said.
On Tuesday, civil aviation authorities gave SpiceJet a reprieve when they asked state-owned oil companies to give credit to the cash-strapped airline for up to 15 days.
The civil aviation ministry also said that banks or other financial institutions would be asked to lend up to $94m (£60m), backed by a personal guarantee of SpiceJet chairman Kalanithi Maran, a well-known media businessman.
The ministry said the measures were aimed at avoiding a collapse which it said would be a ""major setback"" for the airline industry.
Correspondents say the government hopes to save jobs and prevent a repeat of the high-profile collapse of Kingfisher Airlines which was grounded in 2012.
SpiceJet has been making losses since last year.
It has already cut the size of its fleet by a third since September and cancelled dozens of flights a day for the rest of the year.

In pictures: India's dying printing tradition
Calcutta was the hub of India's printing trade in the 19th Century, but with the advent of desktop publishing the industry has modernised and the old hand-printing practices have died out.
Biswanath Baag is among a handful of printers who continue to run a small letterpress in the city. Nazes Afroz has photographed the man and his machines.
Mr Baag has been running his press for the past 40 years from the north Calcutta neighbourhood of Kumartuli. Even though he has set up the latest offset printing facility, he has kept his letterpress in business doing small jobs printing pamphlets, books, letterheads and menu cards.
Mr Baag works out of a small space divided into two storeys - the lower floor houses the press while the loft is where he composes the written material.
In letterpress printing, which has been around since the 15th Century, letters are manually set into a tray, doused with ink and stamped against paper.
Over the years, Mr Baag has composed material in Bengali and English. Here, he is seen working on a menu card for a caterer.
At his press, it's a one-man show where he is the compositor as well as the pressman.
Mr Baag has at least 400kg of Hindi, Bengali and English typefaces in his press and he has to remember which bit is kept in which box.
Once Mr Baag has prepared the written material, he goes down from the loft to the press area with the tray.
As printing starts, he feeds paper into the machine.
Even though the treadle machine runs on electricity, it can also be operated by manual pedalling in case of a power outage.
Mr Baag earns 100 rupees ($1.6; £1) by printing 100 menu cards for this caterer client. The entire job, from composing to printing, takes him about 40 minutes to finish.

In pictures: Mass protests at Jadavpur University
Students at Calcutta's Jadavpur University have been protesting for the past fortnight at the sexual assault of a female student. A government-appointed panel has begun an inquiry, but the students, upset over the universities' decision to call in police against the protesters last week, say that is not enough.
Photographer Ronny Sen went to find out why they are so angry.
Parnab Das
What began as anger over last month's assault has snowballed into fury over the authorities' response. Protests have also spilled outside the university campus, and at the weekend up to 25,000 people marched through Calcutta's streets. Parnab Das is doing a masters course in comparative literature. ""I am also teaching in a school and I plan to leave my job so that I can give my full time to this movement,"" he says.
Supratik Sur Roy
Last Tuesday night, the situation came to a head when university vice-chancellor Abhijit Chakraborty called in police to quell a protest on the campus. Mr Chakraborty says he called in the police because he was under siege and had to be rescued. Dozens of students were injured and admitted to hospital. Supratik Sur Roy, a student of film studies, says it was ""completely unacceptable"" to send ""commandos and police to beat up students who were protesting peacefully"".
Upasana Chakraborty
Ms Chakraborty, an undergraduate student of English, says she was present on the night and that police came inside the campus and beat up the students. She has alleged that her boyfriend was severely beaten up and suffered multiple injuries. The students are now demanding that the vice-chancellor resign and Ms Chakraborty says she will not give up protesting until he quits.
Prabuddha Ghosh
Mr Ghosh, an MPhil student of comparative literature, says: ""I am proud to be a part of this movement. I was not present on the night when police came, but I wish I was there with my friends who were beaten up."" The poster behind him, with the war cry Halla bol (Raise your voice), aptly sums up the mood of the protesting students.
Sanmit Chaterjee
""We are not only fighting against the vice-chancellor, we are addressing other issues as well. We are fighting against many things like moral policing on campus, which is being forcefully imposed on us"", Sanmit Chaterjee says.
Rupsa Sarkar
Ms Sarkar, a mass communication and journalism student, says: ""I don't think our demand to the vice-chancellor for a proper investigation into the molestation was wrong. What was the reason to bring the police inside the campus? The students were peacefully protesting. We will fight against police brutality and until the vice-chancellor resigns.""
Devi
Devi is an ex-student who graduated in 2012. But the protests have seen many former students like her return to the university. Along with some other students, she has been painting and making posters which are being put up across the campus.
Prantick Das
An ex-student of comparative literature and mass communication, Mr Das says he is here because he feels ""very strongly"" about the incident. ""This could have happened to any one of us. Former students who are in different parts of the world are sending messages with their support and solidarity,"" he says.

In pictures: Deadly Kashmir floods
The worst floods in Indian-administered Kashmir in half a century have killed at least 150 people and left the main city of Srinagar under water, as residents are evacuated or retreat to their rooftops.
Some 350 villages are also under water after late-monsoon rains hit the region. Across the border, in Pakistan, floods and house collapses have left more than 180 people dead.
Five days of heavy rain abated over the weekend, but flood waters in Srinagar have risen dramatically. The Jhelum river has flooded large parts of the city and forced residents onto rooftops.
Residents have waded through neck-deep waters with their belongings.  Kashmir's Chief Minister Omar Abdullah said the floods were ""unprecedented"" but urged residents not to panic, saying rescuers would eventually reach them.
A police official in Srinagar told the AFP news agency that he feared the extent of the devastation was not yet known because phone networks were down and areas cut off.  The army headquarters is also under water along with some government buildings.
""Many people may have died and houses collapsed but we are not getting to know much,"" the police officer said, describing the situation as ""catastrophic"".
The flooding is being described as the area's worst in five decades.
India's defence ministry said  thousands of soldiers, backed by 25 helicopters and seven aircraft, are engaged in rescue work and delivering blankets, tents and other relief across the Kashmir valley. More than 14,800 people have been rescued so far, and 50 army medical teams have been deployed, the ministry said.
Touring the region, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi declared the floods a ""national level disaster"" and promised almost $200m in aid and compensation.  Mr Modi has also written to his Pakistani counterpart, Nawaz Sharif, offering his ""deepest sympathies"" to flood-hit victims on that side of the border and offering help.

In pictures: India's coal miners
India is the world's third largest coal producing nation and coal supplies 60% of the country's energy needs, but the coal industry is poorly regulated. Arindam Mukherjee photographs some coal miners going about their work in eastern India.
The coal-rich region in India includes huge swathes of eastern states like Orissa, Jharkhand, West Bengal and Chhattisgarh, and pockets in the central and southern parts of the country.
Most miners spend their days tunnelling, digging and extracting coal from the mines. Here, a group of miners are at work in a mine in West Bengal state's Raniganj district. Each group is led by a sardar (chief) who is responsible for the work of his group.
More than half of India's commercial energy needs are met by coal. It is the main fuel for generating power and making steel and cement. But mining is also a major factor in environment pollution, emitting smoke and noxious gases.
Many of the miners also suffer from lung diseases caused due to inhaling coal dust throughout the day.
Coal mining can be a very hazardous activity and hundreds of miners have died over the years in accidents in mines.
Poor maintenance of the mines is a major factor behind frequent accidents. Once underground, the only way a miner can communicate with the outside world is by using an intercom.
Sunita Devi's husband Santraj Prasad was killed along with 25 others in February 2001 when the Bagdigi colliery in Jharkhand was flooded. She now works as a guard at a mine officer's bungalow in the nearby town of Jharia. Here, she sits at her home with her late husband's photograph and one of her children.
Miner Salim Ansari was the lone survivor of the Bagdigi disaster in which 26 of his colleagues died. He was trapped in an underground air pocket for seven days until rescue workers found him and brought him out.
Lakhan Tanti works as a loader at the government-owned Coal India Limited mine in Ranigunj in West Bengal. He says the company is now hiring contractual labourers instead of salaried employees to cut costs.
Coal mines, like this one in the state of Jharkhand, have multiple floors where excavation takes place and often operate 24 hours a day. Here, a group of miners are going deep inside an underground mine to begin work.
Female labourers are hired to clean and collect coal near the railway line in Bailbandh colliery in Ranigunj. The women are mostly dependents of deceased miners and are employed on humanitarian grounds after the death of their husbands.

"198","Africans in India: From slaves to reformers and rulers","Exhibition showcases role of Africans in India","Africans in India: From slaves to reformers and rulers
By Vikas Pandey BBC Monitoring
This painting shows a reservoir built by an Abyssinian eunuch in the 17th Century
India and Africa have a shared history in trade, music, religion, arts and architecture, but the historical link between these two diverse regions is rarely discussed.
Many Africans travelled to India as slaves and traders, but eventually settled down here to play an important role in India's history of kingdoms, conquests and wars.
Some of them, like Malik Ambar in Ahmadnagar (in western India), went on to become important rulers and military strategists. Ambar was known for taking on the powerful Mughal rulers of northern India.
An exhibition, organised by the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture of The New York Public Library, in Delhi recently showcased such ""forgotten"" stories of Africa's role in India's history.
Abyssinians, also known as Habshis in India, mostly came from the Horn of Africa to the subcontinent. Dr Sylviane A Diouf of the Schomburg Center says Africans were successful in India because of their military prowess and administrative skills.
""African men were employed in very specialised jobs, as soldiers, palace guards, or bodyguards; they were able to rise through the ranks becoming generals, admirals, and administrators,"" she says.
Kenneth Robbins, co-curator of the exhibition, says it is very important for Indians to know that Africans were an integral part of several Indian sultanates and some of them even started their own dynasties.
""Early evidence suggests that Africans came to India as early as the 4th Century. But they really flourished as traders, artists, rulers, architects and reformers between the 14th Century and 17th Century,"" he says.
This 17th-Century cloth painting depicts a procession of Deccani sultan Abdullah Qutb Shah. African guards are seen here as part of the sultan's army.
Apart from the Deccan sultanates in southern India, Africans also rose to prominence on the western coast of India. Some of them brought their traditional music and Sufi Islam with them.
Mr Robbins says Deccan sultans relied on African soldiers because Mughal rulers of northern India did not allow them to recruit men from Afghanistan and other central Asian countries.
This 1887 painting from Kutch portrays the Sidi Damal, a religious, ecstatic dance form of the Muslim Sidis who were brought to India from East Africa.
Dr Diouf says Indian rulers trusted Africans and their skills. ""It was true, especially in areas where hereditary authority was weak and there was ongoing instability due to struggles between factions like in the Deccan,"" she says.
""Africans sometimes did seize power for their group like they did in Bengal - where they were known as the Abyssinian Party - in the 1480s; or in Janjira and Sachin (on the western coast of India) where they established African dynasties. They also took power on an individual basis, as Sidi Masud did in Adoni (in southern India) or Malik Ambar in Ahmadnagar (in western India),"" she adds.
The funerary complex shown in the photograph above was also designed by eunuch Malik Sandal after 1597 in Bijapur (in present-day southern Karnataka state).
This painting from 1590 shows an Indian prince eating in the land of Ethiopians (Habshi) or East Africans (Zangis).
Africans also brought their music to India. This artwork dated 1640-1660 shows a player of the African lyre.
In this 1904 photo taken in Hyderabad in the Deccan region, Africans guards are seen escorting a royal procession.
The most celebrated of the powerful Ethiopian leaders in India was Malik Ambar (1548-1626). His mausoleum still exists in Khuldabad, near Aurangabad district in western India.
This painting shows Nawab Sidi Haidar Khan of Sachin. The African-ruled state of Sachin was established in 1791 in Gujarat. It had its own cavalry and a state band that included Africans, its own coats of arms, currency, and stamped paper. In 1948, when the princely states were incorporated into independent India and ceased to exist, Sachin had a population of 26,000 - 85% Hindu and 13% Muslim - explains Dr Diouf.
The main African figures of the past have not been forgotten but their ethnicity has been erased, consciously or not, she adds.
""The people who have heard of Malik Ambar, for example, generally do not know he was Ethiopian. Does it mean that these men's origin was so irrelevant that it was useless to mention it, or is this historical erasure the product of a conscious denial of the African contribution?"" she asks.

By BBC Trending What's popular and why
The internet's 'bling ring' exposed Watch
A district magistrate scolding civic officials and contractors for what she says is shoddy road construction has become an online hit.
Almost a million people have viewed the footage of B Chandrakala, the District Magistrate of Bulandhshahr, giving the group of men a dressing down since it was posted on Facebook yesterday.
""So much money is coming from the government, but can you see even one developmental work in the city?"" she says on the video.
One of the people she's addressing protests, but Chandrakala is quick to respond: ""Is this the work that is happening? Hit two bricks together and it's over. Is this your work?
""Have some shame,"" she continues. ""This is the public's money.""
""We need Officers like this in India!"" is the title of the video posted on YouTube , and her performance has been applauded by many viewers.
""Its a shame that we have to be proud of people when they do their job,"" commented Munish Nainani on Facebook: ""Goes to show how far the other bureaucrats have fallen who just don't do their job.""
""This is a perfect example to those who think 'what will happen when u give power to a women',"" commented Sunny Sengupta on Facebook. ""This is what happens when u give power to a women ... they have the guts to stand up against corruption ... ma'am a salute to u.""
B Chandrakala told BBC Trending she was on a routine inspection of Bulandhshahr's roads following complaints about the quality of some of the works, and hadn't arranged for the filming to take place.
Rahul Goel, editor of local news website Bulandshahr Express, was one of the first people to post the video on the day the events took place, 11 December.
""The road in question has been constructed and damaged three times already,"" Goel told BBC Trending. ""The road was constructed at night and it would fall apart the next day. Then, it would be constructed again and, again, fall apart. This has happened three times now and people complained.
""We also shared the video on WhatsApp and it went viral in the city. They are hopeful about progress for the first time - they have never seen an official like this before.""
The poor standard of road construction is a commonly-heard complaint in India.

Atul Gawande is an expert on medical error and performance

What do you make of India's under-performing, poorly-funded, leaky public health system, smothered by high population and appalling sanitation?
It is the same health system, by the way, which has helped raise life expectancy from 32 years a few decades ago, to more than 65 today.
What do you make of a health system which pulls off the remarkable feat of eradicating polio - India was home to four-fifths of the world's polio cases in 2002 - in a decade, but where women continue to die delivering babies and during simple sterilisation surgeries?
So does India's health system - like many other things in the country - do the big things well and fare badly in executing the relatively smaller ones?
Surgeon and writer Atul Gawande, who loves grappling with such gruelling questions, believes India's public health system is one of the ""most complex things"" in the world.
And then, in a calm and measured tone, he proceeds to tell you a personal story to illustrate public health's chequered journey in the world's second most populous nation.
This is a country, he tells me, where his grandmother died of malaria before the age of 30, at a time when she had no access to malaria drugs that were then becoming available.  His grandfather, however, lived to the ripe age of 110, in the same village in Maharashtra. His aunts didn't die until into their nineties.
""Simple things like clean water, more irrigation, more crops, more affluence added years to people's lives here. Public health, sanitation and antibiotics also helped,"" he says.
But with Indians living longer, their needs have become wider. A health system designed primarily for infectious diseases was finding it difficult to cope with a new and more complicated swathe of illnesses - from high blood pressure to diabetes.
""The top killer in India is death from cardio-vascular diseases . We are still in an economy with an infrastructure which has not progressed yet to meet the needs of someone who comes in with a heart attack, requires an operation, and wants it be done safely and well,"" he says.
India has some of the best doctors in the world, says Dr Gawande
Dr Gawande, the son of immigrants from India, wears many hats.
In the operating theatre, he practises general and endocrine surgery . In the medical school lecture theatre, he teaches health policy and management.
Outside, he is a writer of best-selling books, mostly riveting essays on the challenges and tricky ethical issues facing modern medicine and about doctors and their mistakes. His recent book, Being Mortal , is an exquisitely crafted and courageous meditation on ageing and death and how doctors can help patients deal with end of life.
""Polio was a big thing, and India made it a small thing,"" says Dr Gawande, 48, who was in Delhi last week to deliver the last of this year's BBC Reith Lectures. ""They got the basics right.""
Authorities got the vaccine, kept it cold, and made sure volunteers go house to house, village after village, and offer vaccines and track and monitor the vaccination drive. How did India even make this happen?
""Well, India was being very systematic. There was a clear message that we have a goal, we are in it together to eliminate the disease. I actually learnt the checklist idea by touring with a WHO [World Health Organization] polio eradication team in Andhra Pradesh,"" says Dr Gawande. The result was his book The Checklist Manifesto: How To Get Things Right , an old-fashioned, nine-chapter checklist primer for doctors to cut complications, infections and hospital deaths.
""Eradicating polio took over a decade. One of my favourite sayings is by Bill Gates: 'We overestimate what we can accomplish in two years, but we underestimate what we can accomplish in 10.'""
But on the flip side, many lives are still lost during simple surgeries and treatments, something which Dr Gawande puts down to a ""functional failure in the organisation and operation in how our [Indian] systems work"".
The sterilisation deaths in Chhattisgarh were a reminder of India's weak public health system
""You have very good people with a lot of experience and good training in India. But if you put some of your best and smartest people in dysfunctional systems, it's demoralising for them and it is unsafe for the others. The easy thing to say is that this is a bad doctor and he will be punished and that will solve the problem. But we all know that it is not the case,"" he says.
The death of 15 women at two state-run sterilisation camps in Chhattisgarh last month is a painful reminder of how India is not getting its essential public health care checklist in order - poor hygiene and contaminated drugs have been blamed.
""The Chhattisgarh incident may be the result of contaminated drugs and production chains along the way, and it just goes to show how complex the system is. Having a great doctor only gets you so far if you are not building the checks and the system for how our drugs, or devices, even our cleaning of the operating rooms and the hospitals, how the basic hygiene is done,"" says Dr Gawande.
We talk about his new and most compelling work so far on mortality, and about building a health care system that will ""actually help people achieve what's most important to them at the end of their lives"".
India, says Dr Gawande, is going through a ""remarkable transformation"" that reflects the breakdown of the family that comes with economic progress, as evident by the rise of retirement complexes and old age homes. The young, having gained economic freedom, are no longer tethered to the needs of the old, and they follow opportunities without really having a plan for their ageing parents.
Eradication of polio is one of India's biggest public health successes
""The plan becomes - the medicines will take care of it. So [the parents] end up in hospitals; we find institutions which really don't recognise them as people. I think we've had a failure of imagination [around the world] about what a good life might be for those last years we are all going to have.""
Things will improve, he believes, when more Indians will have access to pensions - ""becoming old doesn't mean becoming poor"" - and simple things like pain medication. Isn't it a bit ironic, he asks, that although India is one of the largest producers of morphine in the world, a patient in acute pain often finds it very difficult to procure it.
Ageing is a journey each of us must navigate. In the end, Dr Gawande has a Zen-like prescription for people like me who are getting on in years: ""You live longer only when you stop trying to live longer."" I will remember it.

Goa's fight for independence from Portugal
16 December 2014 Last updated at 20:39 GMT
For just over 14 years, Goa remained under Portuguese rule despite the rest of India having won independence from the British in 1947.
Despite a long political campaign for freedom, Goa was only set free when the Indian army marched across the border into the western territory in December 1961.

Delhi drivers get lessons in respecting women
Authorities in the Indian capital, Delhi, have made it compulsory for all taxi and auto-rickshaw drivers to attend ""gender sensitisation"" classes where they are taught how to ensure the safety of women passengers and respect them.
The move comes after a series of high-profile attacks on women in the city in recent months, including the much publicised case of a 26-year-old woman passenger who was allegedly raped by a driver working for the web-based taxi service Uber earlier this month.
The woman had used the Uber smartphone app to book a taxi home on the night of 5 December but said she was taken to a secluded area and raped.
The two-hour programme to train Delhi's 100,000 auto-rickshaw drivers was launched in January and officials say 45,000 have already received their training and certificates. ""The clash is not between men and women, it's a clash of ideas,"" a trainer tells a group of drivers in this image.
""Do you know even whistling at a woman or staring at her is a crime?"" news agency AFP quotes trainer Namrata Sharan as telling a batch of 150 drivers at a recent class. Ms Sharan explains to the drivers what actions could be considered sexual harassment.
Since the Uber case, the transport department in Delhi has made the gender sensitisation classes mandatory for taxi drivers as well as auto-rickshaw drivers. Mental health charity Manas is helping with the training, which is set to begin on 22 December, a spokesperson for Manas told the BBC.
There has been increased focus on the issue of women's safety and crimes against women since the gang rape and murder of a 23-year-old student on a bus in Delhi two years ago. Global outrage forced India's government to introduce tough new anti-rape laws, but crimes against women continue unabated in Delhi and the rest of the country - according to the National Crime Records Bureau, one rape is reported every 16 minutes.
In recent months, some cities like Cochin in the southern state of Kerala have launched taxi services with female drivers - ""She Taxi"" - to provide safe transportation to women passengers. ""She Taxis"" is a fleet of 40 taxis run ""by women, for women"" and is fitted with wireless tracking gear and panic buttons linked to call centres.
Campaigners, however, say gender segregation is not the answer and that women's safety can be achieved only by changing societal attitudes and making men respect women. Auto drivers who have completed the gender sensitisation course in Delhi are given a sticker to display behind their vehicles which says ""this responsible rickshaw respects and protects women"".

A Tamil superstar, methane and graffiti: Three things gripping South India
The news this week was dominated by the rape of a woman in an Uber taxi - every facet of the story was discussed on social media. But there were other issues that gripped the Indian public this week. Several of these stories came from the south of the country. BBC Tamil's Jagadheesan Leklapoodi takes a look.
Rajnikanth mania
This week has seen Tamil audiences in a frenzy over superstar actor Rajnikanth's new film Lingaa, released the day he turned 64.
Even Vodafone India tweeted: ""It's International cake-eating day. Why? Cos it's Rajinikanth's Birthday! Let's celebrate by listening to his playlist""
But it was not a week without controversy. A young film critic, known as Arun,  in Tamil Nadu, says his Facebook account was blocked after the company received thousands of complaints when he criticised Rajnikanth.  Facebook did not respond to a request for a comment from BBC Tamil but Arun says they told him about the complaints and said that his name on Facebook - Arun Tamilstudio - represents a company rather than an individual.
He now has a Facebook page rather than a personal account, but says the incident was an indication of the ability of Rajnikanth fans to silence the critics.
#StopMethaneExplorationInKaveriDelta
Amid the furore over the rape and then the ban on Uber, a rather curious unexpected trend emerged. That was that the opposition to the project to extract methane gas in the Cauvery Delta in southern India was getting a lot of traction.
This is an old dispute. Yet it found its way onto Twitter, presumably because of concerted campaigning activity.  There have been more than 50,000 straight tweets using the above hashtag.
It's all about a project which aims to extract the gas using hydraulic fracturing in the Cauvery river basin in Tamil Nadu and is opposed by activists, farmers and environmentalists. The operation never got under way and was suspended by the government.
The Cauvery river originates in Karnataka and flows into Tamil Nadu. There is also a long-standing dispute  between Karnataka and Tamil Nadu over sharing its waters, dating back to the early part of the 20th Century.
Guess who? Graffiti artists in Kochi
An artist has been drawing on the walls and streets of Kochi (Cochin). An astronaut in a sari, Colonel Saunders serving up Indian food - it's western icons with a traditional Indian twist and unconventional representations of women - and it has got people talking.
Calling itself Guess Who - the artist  or artists - became active just as the biennale kicked off.  On reddit, there has been a detailed discussion about the iconography of this street art. The BBC has also spoken to the artist involved.

BBC Trending What's popular and why
An artist who's been compared to Banksy is gripping audiences on the streets of an Indian city - and online.
Pictures of Guesswho's graffiti on walls and buildings in Kochi (Cochin), in Kerala state on India's southwest coast, are catching attention on the photo-sharing sites, Facebook and Reddit .
Kochi is in the midst of a huge art biennale , and Guesswho's graffiti seems to be a poke at the organised festival. The stencils are a clever mash-up of Western pop culture with Indian icons, and the artist's (or artists') style is certainly influenced by that anonymous yet famous British street artist, Banksy .
Guesswho spoke to BBC Tamil and BBC Trending: he or she wouldn't reveal their identity to us, but they did agree to answer some questions via email.
What can you tell us about yourself? Are you one artist or several? Male or female?
Somebody who likes graffiti.
Do you have a political point?  What's your message?
I don't believe it is art's purpose to send any message. It was mainly an alternative way to use a visual language that people are unfamiliar with here. But at the same time they can connect and communicate with the image and subject while being subtly political. It is also about using public spaces and subversive tactics as potent means of speaking about social realities.
The superheroes and Shikari Shambu with Appi Hippi (a character from a cartoon strip) pieces were done in response to the Kiss of Love campaign that has been going on here.  [BBC Trending previously covered the debate over 'immoral acts' in public ] People who were coming on to the streets to kiss and protest are being arrested. But what if fictional characters do the same? Do they arrest them too?
What are you hoping to achieve?
Unfortunately we don't have a culture of graffiti here [in India] and there aren't many artists who choose to depart from the hierarchies and definitions imposed by the traditional art institutions. It's an effort as a visual artist to start looking for new and meaningful ways to engage a wider audience and inspire more people to take up this as a powerful medium of free expression.
What reaction have you got?
Absolutely amazing so far. Totally unexpected to be honest. Never thought people who don't otherwise care about art and stuff would start talking about it. It certainly seems to have created an interest and opened up doors.
What kind of risks are you taking - what would happen if you get caught?
As long as the images and subjects aren't very provocative and explicit in nature, which is the case now, it should be ok. But the day it becomes otherwise, it could be a problem and one could land in serious trouble.
Graffiti's against the law. What do you say to people who argue it's just vandalism?
Why just point your fingers at graffiti? We live in a visually polluted place. The streets and walls are flooded with movie posters, advertisements, election campaign signs and notices. Are those against the law? Can those also be called vandalism?
Guesswho says: 'On the day India successfully sent a spacecraft into orbit around Mars, a tweet with a picture of female scientists celebrating was an inspiration.'
Do you really think you can keep your identity secret? The Times of India reported that they guessed who you were and rang you.
It is not a question about if one wants to keep the identity a secret, but whether others would understand the reasons behind that and respect it.
What are your future plans - do you plan to post artwork beyond Kochi?  Tackle different subjects? Hang your work in art galleries?
I would certainly love to expand, explore new cultures and do works that are relevant to the cultural characteristics and landscapes of each place. Yes, there are a few things in the pipeline. An alternate medium like graffiti finding a place in a mainstream gallery space would be a very interesting thing to see, but that isn't something new in the West though.
You made a route map of your graffiti in Kochi. Have any of the works been whitewashed yet?
Yes, some of them have been. But isn't it the characteristics of this medium and taken as part of the process?
Finally, do you mind being compared to Banksy?
That would be too much of a compliment ... He has been in the business for decades and has very high standards that not many can catch up to. But of course, as a new kid in the block, would certainly love to know about his thoughts on these works and hope to meet him one day.
Guesswho says: 'Re-imagining popular and iconic images is not really a new tradition in street art. But to use it with reference to the cultural characteristics of the location was the key. The public need to see more unconventional portrayals of women. '
A modern retake of a famous painting by Ravi Varma. Guesswho says the picture was quickly removed by the authorities, citing obscenity as the main reason.

"205","Indian tribal protesters stand up for their rights","Why India's tribes are staging a unique protest","Indian tribal protesters stand up for their rights
By Ashraf Padanna Trivandrum
Indian tribal art form Madhubani to save trees
For more than five months, a group of 50 tribespeople have been standing outside a government office in the southern Indian state of Kerala to press their claim for land and amenities.
They are demanding that the government deliver on its promise of giving land, water and electricity to the community.
Tribespeople comprise nearly 500,000 of Kerala's 33 million people and are mostly landless and desperately poor.
The agitators have travelled to the capital, Trivandrum, from their faraway villages to participate in the protest.
They live in a rented house in the city and arrive at the office at eight every morning to begin what they call ""Nilpu Samaram"" or ""Standing Stir"". They bring their own food.
The tribespeople stand uninterruptedly for nearly 11 hours every day outside the office even as ministers and officials pass them by.
Writers, filmmakers and some political leaders drop in to pledge support. Some donate money; others sing revolutionary songs.
""Many more are willing to come but we are restricting the number to avoid inconvenience to the people,"" protest leader CK Janu says.
Stellar record
At the root of the demonstration is a long and arduous battle that Ms Janu and her fellow travellers have fought for their fundamental rights.
By Indian standards, Kerala has a stellar record in land reform - distributing land to the landless - but it appears to have bypassed its tribespeople.
The tribespeople say they were promised land - ranging from one to five acres per family - by a previous Congress party-led government headed by former chief minister AK Antony after they waged a 48-day-long protest in 2001.
Ms Janu says the number of landless tribal families has now  grown to about 75,000 - up from 35,000 during the 2001 protest when the government promised to allocate 12,000 acres of land for their rehabilitation.
Ms Janu says the tribespeople want to live with dignity
Outsiders sometimes join the protest singing songs in solidarity
When the government failed to keep its promise, Ms Janu led more than 1,000 tribespeople in 2003 to illegally occupy a wildlife sanctuary in Wayanad district.
Armed police and wildlife officials took two days to clear the sanctuary. A tribal and a policeman were killed in pitched battles and police firing.
'Without a break'
Kerala's minister for tribespeople PK Jayalakshmi says the government has met most of the protesters' demands.
The government has so far been able to provide more than 9,000 acres of land to 6,887 families and plans are afoot to give land to another 417 families soon.
""Land is being distributed as per its availability.  It is a continuing process,"" Ms Jayalakshmi says.
But Ms Janu is not convinced.
""There's no water, power and other infrastructure where land has been given to us. Most of the land is not cultivable. Officials are not visiting their new villages in the forests and seeing the conditions our people are living in,"" she says.
""The government should have done its homework properly before the 2001 agreement. We want to live with dignity.""
The protesters mainly live in the three districts of Wayanad, Idukki and Palakkad and, reports say, in recent years, a number of infants have died due to malnutrition and local women have been sexually abused in the tribal settlements by outsiders.
They say it is not easy fighting for your rights standing up the whole day.
Twenty-one-year-old Vineetha's family received an acre of land but, she says, the land cannot be cultivated and is often trampled over by marauding elephants and wild boars in the northern district of Kannur.
Now she participates in the protest every day, with her 42-year-old mother Kamala.
""I have developed body pain and swollen feel as I come here every day and stand without a break,"" she says.
But she is not willing to give up fighting: ""My mother and I are prepared to die here. We will not go back until our demands are met.""

"206","Why segregated housing is thriving in India","Why segregated housing is rising in India","Why segregated housing is thriving in India
Rizwan Kadri moved into a Muslim apartment building from a mixed neighbourhood
Rizwan Kadri runs an architecture firm with three partners, all Hindus, in India's western city of Ahmedabad in Gujarat state.
Son of a revenue official, he grew up in mixed neighbourhoods.  In 2002, massive anti-Muslim riots sparked by the burning of a train carrying Hindu pilgrims, left more than 1,000 people dead in Gujarat.
A few months before the riots, Mr Kadri moved out with his wife and son from a mixed neighbourhood where he had lived for 24 years to a Muslim apartment building in Juhapura, one of India's largest Muslim ghettos , on the outskirts of Ahmedabad.
A year later, his ageing parents joined them. ""The move was prompted by concerns over safety more than anything else,"" says Mr Kadri.
Ahmedabad, the main city of Gujarat, which was ruled by the new PM Narendra Modi for more than a decade, is among the many Indian cities where segregated housing is alive and well.
A range of old reasons like caste and cultural differences - and some relatively new ones such as migration and religious tensions - have led to a proliferation of what urban sociologist Loic Wacquant , referring to ghettos in French and American cities, has described as ""neighbourhoods of exile"".
Juhapura, an obscure village-turned-ghetto of some 400,000 Muslims, is one such neighbourhood of exile.
The heart of this dystopian sprawl is clogged with narrow lanes, tumbledown tenements, overflowing sewers and rubbish mountains. Public transport stays away from the neighbourhood. The wider streets are lined by a rash of new high-rise gated Muslim properties costing up to 6 million rupees (£62,000). A forthcoming gated 14-storey property with some 800 apartments promises a mall, club, separate gyms for men and women, prayer rooms and mosque.
Ghettos are also a great leveller: the stench of rubbish wafts from the grubby low-slung tenements to Mr Kadri's apartment just a mile away, the air is polluted, and the streets are bumpy and pockmarked.
Juhapura is one of India's biggest Muslim ghettos
The wider streets in Juhapura are lined by upmarket Muslim apartments...
...while poorer Muslims live in small apartments in the ghetto's congested lanes
Segregation has inevitably led to curious business opportunities. Sensing that mixed neighbourhoods were fast disappearing and even well-to-do-Muslims were finding it a problem to buy property, Ahmedabad-based entrepreneur Mohammed Ali Husain began a property fair connecting Muslim builders with buyers.
More than 40,000 potential buyers have turned up for the two fairs he's held so far, checking out and buying housing offered by 25 Muslim builders.
""Earlier communities lived in segregated neighbourhoods for cultural reasons,"" say Mr Husain. ""Now the reason is the fear of the other.""
Deep divisions
In a deeply divided and hierarchical society like India, segregated living - and housing - has existed for centuries.
Mumbai has community-based ""vegetarian only"" housing societies. Delhi and Calcutta have Muslim ghettos, crowded, run-down and neglected. A planned apartment coming up in Delhi promises ""dream homes for elite Muslim brotherhood"".
Ahmedabad has been always divided on caste, community and religious lines. But, as analysts say, the ghettoisation was relative in the sense that Muslim-dominated areas co-existed with Hindu-dominated ones.
""These mixed neighbourhoods disappeared after Muslims became the main victims in communal riots which have gone on a par with their growing socio-economic marginalisation,"" write Christophe Jaffrelot and Charlotte Thomas in their study of ghettoisation in Ahmedabad.
The divisions of the past appeared to be more cultural in nature; the divisions of today appear to be rooted in fear, distrust and anomie.
Mr Kadri says he was picking up an order at a burger chain drive-thru a few years ago when he overheard the manager asking one of his delivery boys to not to deliver to Juhapura because, ""people will chop you into pieces if you go there"".
Rising urbanisation was expected to blur religious and social boundaries, but that hasn't happened fully.
So despite the fact that more than a third of India's Muslims live in cities and towns - making them the most urbanised community of a significant size - poverty and discrimination continues to easily push them into ghettos.
Even Dalits - formerly known as untouchables - who escape the stifling caste-based discrimination of their villages to live and work in the cities find that they still end up living in ghettos.
Kamlesh Revabhai Chauhan builds homes for the Dalits
Poorer Dalits live in cheap homes made by Mr Chauhan...
...while better-off ones like Naresh Parmar live in houses with air-conditioning and running water
Kamlesh Revabhai Chauhan is a Dalit builder in Ahmedabad who helps his community members find cheap homes.
He says he has built some 150 tenements and apartments in the last two decades, costing anything between 300,000 and 2 million rupees.
These days, he is building 90 more properties - tiny, self-contained apartments - in Sarkhej on the outskirts of Ahmedabad.
""Dalits are not given housing or shelter by other communities, so they buy homes from me in Dalit areas. They sell their land in the villages and buy homes here,"" he says.
His homes have been bought by policemen, clerks, factory workers,  and traders.
Unkempt tenements
Azadnagar Fathewadi is one such Dalit ghetto.
The better-off residents live in bigger, brightly painted homes, while the poorer ones live in poky, unkempt tenements on a different street.
Naresh Parmar, who lives in a two-bedroom 140 sq yard house with air-conditioning and running water, rents out his two road rollers for a living.
Ten years ago, he bought this house from Mr Chauhan for five million rupees. There is a swing and a rope-bed on the verandah.
""This is like my village. I like the environment. When it becomes crowded like the city, I will pack up and go back to the village,"" he says.
There is almost what many say is a consensual silence on segregated living.
Last month, Mumbai's municipality passed a resolution saying it should stall a residential project if the builder plans to sell it on ""grounds of caste, religion or food preferences"". It is not clear whether this can be enforced.
In the end, segregated housing - now increasingly driven by religious discrimination - is a blight on India's progress.
""This marks the end of intimacy and formal integration of communities that every modern, civilised society needs,"" says political psychologist Ashis Nandy.
Mr Kadri, 45, offers his example to show how such segregation is harming India. ""I am what I am because I grew up in a cosmopolitan environment in mixed neighbourhoods,"" he says.
""Unfortunately my 12-year-son does not have the same privilege as he's growing up in a ghetto. This is a big tragedy. We are moving backwards.""

"207","'Support vulnerable doctors' call","Up to 28 doctors took their own lives between 2005 and 2013 while being investigated by the General Medical Council, an independent review of cases has found.","Report calls for more support for vulnerable doctors
Up to 28 doctors took their own lives between 2005 and 2013 while being investigated by the General Medical Council, a review of cases has found.
Many had suffered from mental health, drug or or alcohol problems.
The independent report recommends that a national support service be set up to help vulnerable doctors.
The GMC, which investigates about 3,000 complaints about doctors each year, said its processes should be ""quick, simple and low stress"".
Continue reading the main story
“Start Quote
Our first duty must, of course, be to protect patients but we are determined to do everything we can to make sure we handle these cases as sensitively as possible”
End Quote Niall Dickson GMC chief executive
The independent report, based on a review of GMC cases over eight years, found that 24 doctors undergoing fitness to practise investigations were classified as ""suicide"" and four as ""suspected suicide"".
Many of the doctors suffered from a recognised mental disorder, such as depression, bipolar disorder and personality disorder, or had addiction problems.
Other factors in their deaths may have included marriage breakdown, financial hardship and the impact of the GMC investigation.
The report calls on the GMC to treat every doctor as ""innocent until proven guilty"".
It also recommends appointing a senior medical officer from the GMC to oversee cases involving doctors with health problems.
'Stressful experience'
The GMC said it has made significant improvements to its fitness-to-practise investigations process in recent years - but recognises that it could offer more support to doctors.
Niall Dickson, chief executive of the General Medical Council, said: ""We know too that for any doctor, being investigated by the GMC is a stressful experience and very often follows other traumas in their lives.
""Our first duty must, of course, be to protect patients but we are determined to do everything we can to make sure we handle these cases as sensitively as possible, to ensure the doctors are being supported locally and to reduce the impact of our procedures.""
He said the aim was to handle complaints as quickly and effectively as possible.
The GMC will now review it procedures for dealing with doctors with health problems.
Dr Clare Gerada, medical director of the Practitioner Health Programme, a support service for doctors in London, said she welcomed the review.
""They [the GMC] need to continue to show their commitment to reducing the impact of fitness-to-practise investigations on vulnerable doctors whilst always maintaining patient safety - a substantial task.
""Doctors are sometimes patients too and supporting vulnerable doctors is a shared responsibility.""
Dr Gerada said the British Medical Association, the Royal College of Psychiatrists and the Practitioner Health Programme should all be involved in implementing the GMC's recommendations.
Dr Michael Devlin, the head of professional standards and liaison, at the MDU said: ""We welcome the acknowledgment that delays in GMC investigations increase the stress on doctors and also that there should be a presumption of innocence until allegations about a doctor's conduct, performance or health have been fully and properly investigated.
""Doctors facing GMC investigation need the help of their medical defence organisation and the MDU's medico-legal advisers and lawyers are usually the first port of call for professional and personal support.""

The precise part of the brain that gives people a sense of direction has been pinpointed by scientists.
People with stronger nerve signals in their ""internal compass"" tended to be better navigators.
The study, published in the journal Current Biology, suggested people get lost when their compass cannot keep up.
The researchers in London hope the discovery will help explain why direction sense can deteriorate in conditions such as Alzheimer's disease.
Scientists have long believed that such as signal existed within the brain, but until now it had been pure speculation.
Researchers at University College London (UCL) asked 16 volunteers to familiarise themselves with a simple virtual courtyard.
Volunteers were asked to navigate towards certain objects placed in four corners of the virtual room
They were then asked to navigate the area, from memory alone, while their brains were being scanned by an MRI machine.
The scans revealed a part of the brain - known as the entorhinal region - fired up consistently during the tasks.
The stronger the signal in the region, the better the volunteers were at finding their way around correctly.
Dr Hugo Spiers, who led the study, said: ""Studies on London cab drivers have shown that the first thing they do when they work out a route is calculate which direction they need to head in.
""We now know the entorhinal cortex is responsible for such calculations and the quality of the signals from this region seem to determine how good someone's navigational skills will be.""
Dr Martin Chadwick, who was also involved in the study, explained: ""Our results provide evidence to support the idea that your internal compass readjusts as you move through the environment.
""For example if you turn left, then your entorhinal region should process this to shift your facing direction and goal direction accordingly.
""If you get lost after taking too many turns, this may be because your brain could not keep up and failed to adjust.""
Degenerative diseases
Previous work by UCL researchers uncovered the role the entorhinal region plays in helping people understand what direction they are facing.
This new work suggests the area also helps them decide which direction to move in when heading to a new location.
Dr John Isaac, from the Wellcome Trust, which funded the study, said: ""Why some people are better navigators than others is intrinsically interesting, but it also helps us explain the processes that go wrong in degenerative diseases such as dementia - leaving people feeling lost and confused.""

Painkiller may cut dementia risk
Regularly taking aspirin and ibuprofen may help protect against some forms of skin cancer, research suggests.
An Australian analysis of all studies to date found that non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) reduced the risk of squamous cell carcinoma by 18%.
The drugs have previously been linked to a reduced risk of other cancers, including colon cancer.
Experts said staying out of the sun and wearing sun cream were the most effective ways to avoid skin cancer.
The theory that NSAIDs such as aspirin may protect against skin cancer has been raised before, but the overall evidence had been unclear.

A safer option for those who wish to reduce their likelihood of skin cancer may be to spend a few minutes a day less outside”
End Quote Prof Brian Diffey Newcastle University
So researchers did an analysis of nine studies looking at use of the drugs and the risk of squamous cell carcinoma - the most common form of skin cancer.
Reporting in the Journal of Investigative Dermatology , they found that taking any NSAID was associated with an 18% lower risk of developing the cancer.
And taking NSAIDs other than aspirin was linked with a 15% reduced risk.
Side effects
It is the most convincing evidence so far that the drugs help prevent the development of squamous cell carcinoma.
But experts still cannot be sure of the effects because some factors -  such as how much sun someone is exposed to or even what doses of the drugs they take - have been difficult to pin down with any accuracy.
It is thought that NSAIDs, which also include diclofenac, may prevent skin cancer because they inhibit an enzyme called COX-2, which is involved in tumour development.
The researchers did find a greater degree of reduced risk associated with use of the drugs in people with pre-cancerous growths or a history of skin cancer.
It raises the possibility that the drugs could be used as a preventive treatment in some groups.
Some people are prescribed NSAIDs long term for conditions such as arthritis, but they are not recommended for regular use in healthy people because of side effects, which can include, in rare cases, bleeding in the stomach.
Prof Dorothy Bennett, an expert in cell biology, at St George's, University of London, said the results were worth knowing about.
But the drugs' side effects would likely prevent their routine use in everyone.
""Noting that most [squamous cell carcinomas] are curable by surgery if caught early, this reduction in risk is interesting, but it is hard to say whether it is worth taking action over it.""
Prof Brian Diffey, emeritus professor of photobiology, dermatological sciences at Newcastle University, said that reducing the risk of skin cancer by the same magnitude seen in the study could be done with a small reduction in sun exposure.
""Given that long-term therapy with NSAIDs is not without risk, a safer option for those who wish to reduce their likelihood of skin cancer may be to spend a few minutes a day less outside.""

"210","Autism link to air pollution raised","A link between autism and air pollution during pregnancy has been suggested by scientists.","Autism link to air pollution raised
By James Gallagher Health editor, BBC News website
Air pollution link to 28,000 deaths
A link between autism and air pollution exposure during pregnancy has been suggested by scientists.
The Harvard School of Public Health team said high levels of pollution had been linked to a doubling of autism in their study of 1,767 children.
They said tiny particulate matter, which can pass from the lungs to the bloodstream, may be to blame.
Experts said pregnant women should minimise their exposure, although the link had still to be proven.
Air pollution is definitely damaging. The World Health Organization estimates it causes 3.7 million deaths each year .
The study, published in Environmental Health Perspectives , investigated any possible link with autism.
Pollutants
It analysed 245 children with autism and 1,522 without.
By looking at estimated pollution exposure during pregnancy, based on the mother's home address, the scientists concluded high levels of pollution were more common in children with autism.
The strongest link was with fine particulate matter - invisible specks of mineral dust, carbon and other chemicals - that enter the bloodstream and cause damage throughout the body.
Nitrogen dioxide is a by-product of diesel engines
Yet, the research is unable to conclusively say that pollution causes autism as there could be other factors that were not accounted for in the study.
Consistent pattern
There is a large inherited component to autism, but lead researcher Dr Marc Weisskopf said there was mounting evidence that air pollution may play a role too.
He said: ""The specificity of our findings for the pregnancy period, and third trimester in particular, rules out many other possible explanations for these findings.
""The evidence base for a role for maternal exposure to air pollution increasing the risk of autism spectrum disorders is becoming quite strong.
""This not only gives us important insight as we continue to pursue the origins of autism spectrum disorders, but as a modifiable exposure, opens the door to thinking about possible preventative measures.""
Prof Frank Kelly, the director of the environmental research group at King's College London, told the BBC: ""I think if it was this study by itself I wouldn't take much notice, but it's now the fifth that has come to the same conclusion.
""It is biologically plausible, the placenta is there to ensure the foetus has optimal supply of nutrients, but if chemicals are entering the mother's body then the foetus will have access to those too.
""Women should be made aware of the potential links so they don't get excessive exposure.""

Levels of obesity are rising across Europe
Where are you on the global fat scale?
Obesity can constitute a disability in certain circumstances, the EU's highest court has ruled.
The European Court of Justice was asked to consider the case of a male childminder in Denmark who says he was sacked for being too fat.
The court said that if obesity could hinder ""full and effective participation"" at work then it could count as a disability.
The ruling is binding across the EU.

If employers suddenly have to start ensuring that they've got wider seats, larger tables, more parking spaces for people who are obese, I think then we're just making the situation worse”
End Quote Jane Deville Almond British Obesity Society
Judges said that obesity in itself was not a disability - but if a person had a long-term impairment because of their obesity, then they would be protected by disability legislation.
The case centres around childminder Karsten Kaltoft who weighs about 160kg (25 stone).
He brought a discrimination case against his employers of 15 years, Billund local authority, after he was sacked four years ago.
The authority said a fall in the number of children meant Mr Kaltoft was no longer required.
But Mr Kaltoft said he was dismissed because he was overweight.
'No problems'
Earlier this year, he told the BBC that reports that he was so fat he was unable to bend down to tie children's shoelaces were untrue.
Describing his work with children, he said: ""I can sit on the floor and play with them, I have no problems like that.
""I don't see myself as disabled. It's not OK just to fire a person because they're fat, if they're doing their job properly.""
The Danish courts asked the European Court of Justice (ECJ) to clarify whether obesity was a disability.
The ECJ ruled that if the obesity of the worker ""hinders the full and effective participation of that person in professional life on an equal basis with other workers"", then obesity can fall within the concept of ""disability"".
Rulings from the European Court of Justice are binding for all EU member nations.
The courts in Denmark will now have to assess Mr Kaltoft's weight to see if his case can be classed as a disability.
Analysis by Clive Coleman, BBC's legal correspondent
Today's ruling was of great interest to employers across Europe. The judgement makes no direct link between Body Mass Index and obesity, but is a powerful statement that an obese worker whose weight hinders their performance at work is entitled to disability protection.
That will mean employers must, on a case by case basis, make reasonable adjustments such as providing larger chairs or special car parking, and protect such employees from verbal harassment.
But there are wider implications. Providers of goods and services such as shops, cinemas and restaurants will also have to make reasonable adjustments for their customers, which might include things like special seating arrangements.
The key concept here is that adjustments must be ""reasonable"" - so it may be deemed reasonable for a Premier League football club to make two seats available for someone disabled through obesity, but not for a small, non-league club.
Obesity, particularly what is sometimes known as morbid or severe and complex obesity, can be a particularly sensitive subject.
Employers and service providers will have to take care not to make assumptions about the needs of an obese worker or customer.
'Wider seats'
Jane Deville Almond, the chairwoman of the British Obesity Society, said obesity should not be classed as a disability.
She told the BBC: ""I think the downside would be that if employers suddenly have to start ensuring that they've got wider seats, larger tables, more parking spaces for people who are obese, I think then we're just making the situation worse.
Employers could be required to make their offices more accessible for obese employees
""[It is] implying that people have no control over the condition, rather than something that can be greatly improved by changing behaviour.""
Paul Callaghan, head of employment law at international law firm Taylor Wessing, said the ruling does not change UK law.
""The European Court of Justice has ruled that obesity itself is not a disability, but that the effects of it can be.
""As such, workers who suffer from, for example, joint problems, depression, or diabetes - specifically because of their size - will be protected by the European Equal Treatment Framework Directive and cannot be dismissed because of their weight.""
Employers' responsibility
Audrey Williams, employment law partner at Eversheds, said the mere fact someone is obese is not enough to make them disabled.
""What the court are saying is that obesity is not protected unless it hinders professional life.""
She said the ruling would increase awareness among employers of their responsibility towards obese employees in the workplace.
This could include making reasonable adjustments to working arrangements, seating arrangements or making access to the office easier.
However, Tam Fry, from the National Obesity Forum, said the ruling had opened a can of worms for UK employers.
""They will be required to make adjustments to their furniture and doors and whatever is needed for very large people.
""I believe it will also cause friction in the workplace between obese people and other workers.""
One in four people in the UK is classified as obese.

People experience redness and swelling when taking certain medicines
Peanut allergy treatment 'a success'
Allergic reactions to drugs and injections could stem from one single protein, research in mice suggests.
That protein may be responsible for itching, swelling and rashes suffered by people taking a wide range of medicines.
Such reactions stop people completing treatments and can sometimes be fatal.
Writing in the journal Nature, scientists say they are exploring ways to block the protein and reduce these side-effects.
Redness and rashes
Researchers from the Johns Hopkins University, in Maryland, and the University of Alberta focused on reactions triggered by medicines prescribed for a number of conditions - from diabetes to HIV.
These reactions, also seen after some antibiotics or anti-cancer treatments, can spark a range of symptoms from redness to rashes.
They are different to the allergic reactions caused by food and those experienced by hay fever sufferers.
Scientists tested mice with and without a single protein - named MRGPRB2 - on their cells.
Mice without the protein did not suffer any redness, rashes or swelling despite being given drugs known to provoke reactions.
And changes in blood pressure and heart rate - hallmarks of potentially dangerous reactions - were reduced.
Injections - including vaccinations - can lead to allergic reactions
Dr Benjamin McNeil, at John Hopkins University School of Medicine, said: ""It's fortunate that all of the drugs turn out to trigger a single receptor - it makes that receptor an attractive drug target.""
And if a new drug to block the protein receptor could be made, Dr McNeil said, this would help reduce the side-effects many patients currently endured.
Maureen Jenkins, clinical director of Allergy UK, said: ""Allergic disease affects the immune system and the reactions are often very complex.
""All new methods to try and understand these reactions and to develop target treatments are welcomed.""
Scientists are now investigating whether the same protein could be behind certain skin conditions - such as rosacea and psoriasis.
These conditions can result in patches of redness and rashes, but their cause is currently unknown.

Smoking in cars with children will be banned in England, under new laws put forward by the government.
The regulations laid before Parliament propose banning smoking in cars containing under 18s.
A fine of £50 will be issued to people who smoke or who fail to prevent another person smoking.
MPs will vote on the plans before the election - and if they are passed the change in law will come into force on 1 October.
The move comes after a free vote in Parliament in February gave ministers the power to introduce the law, although it did not compel them to.
Dr Hilary Wareing says children exposed to second-hand smoke in cars are more likely to have respiratory infections
Public health minister Jane Ellison said: ""Second-hand smoke is a real threat to children's health and we want them to grow up free from the risks of smoking.
""The only effective way to protect children is to prevent them breathing second-hand smoke and our plans to stop smoking in cars carrying children will help us to do this.""
Smoking in cars
Smoke can stay in the air for up to two and a half hours even with a window open.
Second-hand smoke contains more than 4,000 chemicals, some of which are known to cause cancer.
Exposure has been strongly linked to chest infections, asthma, ear problems and cot death in children.
Research indicates 300,000 children in the UK visit a GP each year because of the effects of second-hand smoke, with 9,500 going to hospital.
Smoking in a car creates a higher concentration of toxins than in a bar, some research has put it at 11 times higher.
Bans on smoking in cars when children are present already exist in some US states, including California, as well as in parts of Canada and Australia.
Deborah Arnott, chief executive of Action on Smoking and Health, said: ""We are delighted. We also urge the government to put the regulations on standardised packaging to Parliament before the general election.
""This, together with the protection of children from second-hand smoke in cars, will help de-normalise smoking and protect children from this deadly addiction.""
But Simon Clark, director of smokers' lobby group Forest, said: ""The government is taking a sledgehammer to crack a nut. The overwhelming majority of smokers know smoking in a car with children is inconsiderate and they don't do it.
""The regulations are unnecessary and excessive. Do we really want to criminalise people for lighting a cigarette in a private vehicle?""
A ban on smoking in cars has also been put forward in Scotland and Wales. Northern Ireland said it was considering a ban.

Teenagers experiencing mental health problems will no longer be detained in police cells as a ""place of safety"".
Home Secretary Theresa May will announce later an overhaul of mental health laws in England and Wales.
The government review is also set to recommend adults should only be kept in a police cell as a place of safety in exceptional circumstances.
It comes after a 16-year-old girl was kept in police cells for two days last month because of a lack of care beds.
There is no place for this in our society”
End Quote Theresa May Home Secretary
Her situation, in Torquay, came to public attention when Paul Netherton, assistant chief constable at Devon and Cornwall Police, tweeted his concerns. She was eventually found a bed on an adult psychiatric ward .
The joint Home Office and Department of Health review of sections 135 and 136 of the Mental Health Act also recommends reducing the maximum length of detention for someone in mental distress from 72 hours to 24 hours.
Home Secretary Theresa May said: ""Too frequently it is a police officer who responds to a vulnerable person in crisis, and I am determined to put an end to children who are suffering a mental illness being detained in police cells.
""There is no place for this in our society.
""Vulnerable children and adults should be treated by police with respect and compassion, but I am very clear that it is the job of health professionals to provide the proper healthcare and support required.""
'Funds needed'
Sarah Brennan, chief executive of mental health charity YoungMinds, said that in order for the plans to work, more beds had to be made available for teenagers going through ""the truly frightening experience of a mental health crisis"".
She said: ""It is appalling that children and young people are held in police cells because there is no other place of safety for them.
""However, this legislation alone is not the answer. There must be funds available so that there is an increase in the number of safe appropriate beds that local areas can access easily and quickly.
""If this does not happen then the change to the law will have a knock-on effect that will see children and young people transported hundreds of miles across the country or placed on adult wards which the Mental Health Act already states should not happen.""
Care and Support Minister Norman Lamb said: ""It's essential that anyone experiencing a mental health crisis gets urgent, compassionate care in the right environment.
""I've been very clear that I want to ban the use of police cells for under 18s who need mental health care and I'm pleased that this is one of the main recommendations of the review.""
He said the use of police cells for adults and children with mental health problems had reduced by 24% this year.
Efi Hershkovitz, chief executive and founder of private care provider for young people Danshell, said: ""This is a step in the right direction but the government must ensure that 'place of safety' beds are available for these vulnerable young people.  It is not enough to pay lip service to the problem.""
The number of times police cells have been used to hold mentally ill people in England has fallen from 8,667 occasions in 2011-12 to 6,028 in 2013-14, according to the Health and Social Care Information Centre , which collates information for the Department of Health.
The home secretary had announced the launch of the review in May 2013.

"215","Rules for babies 'from three people'","The rules for creating babies from three people - which state only two would be classed as parents - have been announced by the UK government.","Rules for babies 'from three people'
By James Gallagher Health editor, BBC News website
The rules for creating babies from three people - which state only two would be classed as parents - have been announced by the UK government.
The fertility technique uses material from the mother, father and a donor woman to prevent deadly diseases.
MPs will soon vote on whether to make the UK the first country in the world to legalise the procedure.
Opponents say it is unethical to make babies with DNA from three people and that it represents a ""slippery slope"" .
The UK scientists that have led the research hope to offer the procedure next year.
Some families have lost up to seven children to ""mitochondrial diseases"" that leave the body with insufficient energy to function.
Mitochondria are the microscopic power stations in nearly every cell of the body.
Defective mitochondria are passed only from mother to child so scientists in the UK have pioneered therapies that use functioning mitochondria from a donor woman.
However, mitochondria have a tiny amount of their own DNA so any resulting child would have genetic information from three people.
The structure of a cell
Nucleus: Where the majority of our DNA is held, which contains the genetic instructions for building and running the human body
Mitochondria: Often described as the cells' power stations, these convert energy into a form cells can use. They also contain 0.1% of the total number of genes in a person.
Cytoplasm: The jelly like substance that contains the nucleus and mitochondria
The regulations put before Parliament state:
The fertility regulator must assess each case for a significant risk of disability or serious illness
Fertility clinics would need a new licence to offer the technique
The woman donating her egg would not be related to the child
Any child born would have no right to information about the donor
In practice it means that only the most severely affected women - perhaps 10 cases per year - would go ahead.
And doctors in Newcastle, where the technique has been pioneered, would initially be the centre offering it.
The regulations will remain in draft form until they are voted on by Parliament and are signed off by ministers.
This is expected to take place before the general election in May 2015.
Public Health Minister Jane Ellison said: ""The government considers that the time is now right to give Parliament the opportunity to consider and vote on these regulations.""
Delight
Prof Doug Turnbull, from Newcastle University, told BBC News: ""I'm delighted that it's being moved forward to the next stage. It's a long process but it's great news.
""We want to apply for a licence next year and hope to do it [the procedure] in 2015.""
A scientific review by the fertility The Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority said there was no evidence that it would be unsafe, but called for final checks .
Deadly
Baby Jessica was born with Leigh's disease, a type of mitochondrial disease, and she has to be fed through a tube.
One in every 6,500 babies has severe mitochondrial disease.
""They did warn us she may not reach her toddler years,"" her mother Victoria Holliday said.
She and partner Keith Newell want more children but are unwilling to risk another child suffering in the same way as Jessica.
""It's not fair that if there's a scientific technique out there that could stop this happening in the future that we're not using it,"" Victoria said.
Dr David King, from the the campaign group Human Genetics Alert, said: ""This is hi-tech medicine at its worst and most unnecessary.
""Medical researchers are crossing the crucial ethical line that will open the door to designer babies based on scientific misinformation and ignoring majority public opposition.
""There are already safe and reliable ways to avoid these conditions, so why put the child's health at risk purely so that mothers can be genetically related to them?""
How is it done?
Two separate techniques are being devised, but they both share the same common principle - take the DNA from the parents and combine it with healthy mitochondria from a female donor.

Colchester Hospital was subject to two reviews over allegations about cancer data and staff bullying
Cancer hospital in criminal inquiry
Inaccuracies in a hospital's cancer waiting times figures were caused by managerial incompetence rather than bullying of staff, investigators found.
An inquiry into Colchester Hospital in Essex found evidence of ""sub-optimal care"" but nothing to suggest systematic data manipulation.
A separate review found evidence of ""serious managerial failures"".
The hospital's chief executive apologised to patients who received ""poor care"" or delayed treatment.
""I am very pleased there appears to be no evidence of systematic data manipulation at the trust,"" said Dr Lucy Moore.
""It is important that we now rebuild confidence in the cancer services provided here in Colchester.""
The hospital was placed in special measures last year after a visit from Care Quality Commission inspectors
Colchester Hospital University NHS Foundation Trust was placed in special measures in November 2013 after inspectors from the Care Quality Commission (CQC) raised ""serious concerns"" about staff coming under pressure from managers to manipulate cancer waiting times in order to meet government targets.
The trust conducted a ""retrospective review"" of 822 cancer patients' cases who were treated between 2010 and 2014 following the CQC's report.
It found 16 cases of ""possible deliberate and inappropriate data entry"" but reviewers did not find a deliberate intent to falsify figures.
Cancer data 'inaccuracies'
Evidence of ""poor documentation and record keeping"" was uncovered, as well as a number of patients who experienced ""sub-optimal care, diagnosis or treatment"".
The report said it was impossible to establish the extent to which patients suffered as a result, but there was clear evidence of harm to at least one patient.
The East of England Strategic Clinical Network, which reviewed the report, said ""there was evidence of inaccuracies in the cancer waits data"", but this was as likely to negatively affect the trust's performance as it was to enhance it.
""This suggested the issue was one of effectiveness and competence in the cancer management team, rather than a deliberate manipulation,"" the network said.
Two separate but related reviews revealed cancer data had not been manipulated, nor staff bullied
A separate but related inquiry was led by former Anglia Cancer Network chair Carole Taylor-Brown, and former Deputy Chief Medical Officer of England, Prof Pat Troop.
The report was overseen by health regulator Monitor.
It found evidence of poor governance and poor knowledge of whistle-blowing policies.
By Julian Sturdy, BBC East investigations editor
After a torrid year at Colchester Hospital, the allegations of bullying and falsifying cancer records are finally dismissed.
The inquiries have been time-consuming and demoralising, but now the hospital can start to concentrating on patient care.
The task ahead is enormous: morale in some departments is low, there's a shortage of staff, high employee turnover and just last month inspectors found staff talking abruptly to patients, failing to treat them with dignity.
Managers still need to get a grip.
Its financial fortunes are also grim. It has gone from a surplus last year to a £14m deficit this financial year.
But fixing the money would mean cancelling operations, delaying clinics and freezing recruitment.
It needs a clean slate to get through this winter.
Patients have suffered from negligence in the past. This is Colchester's chance to start again.
A chance to change the culture and finally put people first.
But it stated: ""At no time were individuals instructed or bullied to amend cancer or any other data inappropriately by any senior manager.""
There was criticism of the way former Finance Director Mike Baker, supported by former Workforce Director Rob Bowman, carried out an original investigation into the allegations in 2012.
Mr Baker resigned when the CQC revealed the allegations.
He told the BBC last December: ""I was planning to retire and when I read the report I decided to bring it forward and I resigned. I feel I let my people down.""
The hospital trust apologised ""unreservedly"" to patients who suffered delays or poor care
Those who conducted the inquiry were told a new ""validation process"" was introduced to the cancer service in 2011.
When one of the team members began to notice changes to the data - which they believed were incorrect - they raised concerns with senior managers, including associate director of the cancer department, Mark Jarman-Howe, who believed the data was correct.
An investigation into the concerns began in February 2012, which has been described as ""flawed and mismanaged"".
The report said Mr Jarman-Howe's decisions about how to validate data were out of step with his colleagues' understanding of Cancer Waiting Time Guidance.
Mr Jarman-Howe left the trust in 2012.
Cancer services manager at Colchester Hospital, Rachael West, was suspended on full pay in November last year while the allegations were investigated.
Both Ms West and Mr Jarman-Howe, along with other senior manages, were cleared of any bullying and harassment and deliberately manipulating data.
Dr Moore told the BBC that Ms West's future at the trust would be discussed in light of the report.
The hospital said it had made a number of improvements to its cancer services over the last year
The trust's Chairman Peter Wilson said although no evidence was found of a ""systematic culture of bullying"", the issue is taken ""very seriously""
Adam Cayley, regional director at Monitor, said: ""Today's report should bring a very difficult chapter in the history of this trust to a close.
""It is reassuring to find that there is no evidence of staff being bullied into changing cancer data, but it is even clearer that there were serious managerial failures at the trust.""
""The new management team at the hospital is already delivering improvements for patients - a process we expect to see continue,"" he said.

By Emma Wilkinson Health reporter, BBC News
Breastfeeding 'cuts depression risk'
Women with or at risk of mental health problems should receive extra support at all stages of pregnancy and beyond, updated NHS guidelines say.
They come a fortnight after the bodies of Charlotte Bevan, 30, and her four-day-old daughter Zaani were found in the Avon Gorge after they went missing from a maternity hospital in Bristol.
NICE hopes its advice will help NHS staff identify mental health problems.
A fifth of women have depression or anxiety in the year after giving birth.
Charlotte Bevan sparked a major police search when she left the hospital without a coat and wearing hospital slippers, with her baby wrapped only in blankets
Ms Bevan is believed to have suffered from schizophrenia and depression and had been sleep-deprived after giving birth.
A review into the circumstances that led to her disappearance is being carried out by University Hospitals Bristol NHS Trust.
NICE said the impact on families of mental health problems during and after pregnancy can be long-lasting.
As well as anxiety and depression, there is an increased risk of psychosis in the weeks after giving birth and others may experience obsessive compulsive disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, tokophobia (an extreme fear of childbirth) and eating disorders.
NICE said that although such problems responded well to treatment, they frequently went unrecognised and untreated.
Under its recommendations, which update the last advice given in 2007:
Counselling on the potential implications of pregnancy should be given to all women of childbearing age who have a new, existing or past mental health problem
In early pregnancy, mental health and wellbeing should be talked about at the first booking in appointment as well as specific questions to identify depression
For any woman with a mental health problem during or after pregnancy, there should be an integrated care plan in place that sets out the treatment and which health professionals are responsible for care
The guidelines also advise on the most appropriate drugs and treatments that can be offered safely during pregnancy and breastfeeding and supporting women in weighing up the pros and cons
Women and their partners who have experienced a traumatic event such as a very difficult birth should be offered extra support
And there are clear recommendations about what should be offered to mothers who have suffered a miscarriage or whose baby is stillborn
Prof Mark Baker, NICE Centre for Clinical Practice director, said: ""Giving women the right treatment at the right time can have a profound effect - not just for the mother, but her family too.
""The effect of getting this right can last for years.""
Expert groups strongly welcomed the guidelines but warned of a dire national shortage of specialist perinatal mental health services.
A recent NCT survey of 186 Clinical Commissioning Groups in England found ""huge gaps"" with only 3% reporting they had a perinatal mental health strategy.
Royal College of Midwives chief executive Cathy Warwick said: ""We desperately need more midwives and maternity support workers to work with these hard-to-reach and vulnerable women.""
Dr Liz MacDonald, who chairs the Royal College of Psychiatrists' perinatal faculty, agreed there was ""gross inequality"" in access to perinatal mental health services ""which is putting the wellbeing of thousands of mothers, infants and families in jeopardy"".

A £2.7bn fund to improve public health in England is not always being spent where most needed, a watchdog says.
The ring-fenced grant, paid to local authorities by Public Health England, is supposed to encourage healthier lifestyles and reduce disparities in life expectancies across the country.
The National Audit Office said some progress had been made but it was too soon to say if it was value for money.
Public Health England was set up in April last year.
Under the government's NHS reforms, responsibility for public health, which covers everything that prevents disease and prolongs life, has been passed to local government.
The NAO said Public Health England had made a ""good start"" in supporting councils in their new roles.
It said spending on public health ""varies widely"" between different areas, saying this was ""not surprising"" given local differences.
Spending risk
But it went on to highlight that areas where alcohol abuse increased the most between 2010/11 and 2012/13 were spending ""significantly less"" on alcohol services in the following year than the areas where levels of abuse had fallen.
""Some local authority spending decisions are not yet fully aligned with areas of concern,"" it concluded.
The NAO also said records of how the cash has been allocated by some local authorities were inaccurate.
Funding for public health went up by 5.5% in 2013/14 but the government has not decided how long the ring-fence will remain in place and the NAO warned that contingency plans must be put in place to deal with changes in funding.
""There is a risk that total public health spending will decline as local authorities face continued budget reductions,"" it said.
'Unacceptable'
The report also highlighted the continued wide gaps in healthy life expectancy, which for men ranges from 52.5 years in Tower Hamlets to 70 years in Richmond upon Thames.
Labour MP Margaret Hodge, who chairs the Public Accounts Committee, said this disparity was ""unacceptable"".
She said: ""Good public health is critical to reducing the burden on local health economies and the wider NHS at a time when the health service is facing unprecedented financial challenges, as well as improving the lives of individuals.""

Ebola: Sierra Leone begins house-to-house searches
The authorities want to ensure that anyone who may be displaying symptoms of Ebola comes forward for treatment
Sierra Leone has begun house-to-house searches in the capital Freetown to find hidden cases of Ebola.
President Ernest Bai Koroma said that Sunday trading would be banned and travel between districts restricted.
The president said that as Christmas approached, people would need to be reminded that Sierra Leona was at war with a ""vicious enemy"".
Sierra Leone has overtaken Liberia to have the highest number of Ebola cases, World Health Organization figures show.
The virus has killed more than 6,800 people this year, mostly in Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea.
Sierra Leone has had more Ebola cases than any other country
In his statement, President Koroma said the searches aimed to ""break the chain of transmission"".
He added: ""Do not hide the sick.""
The president said that while many districts of the country had made progress in fighting Ebola, challenges still remained in the western part of the country, which for the past two weeks had accounted for 50% of new infections.
He said that he was introducing an action plan, Operation Western Area Surge, to encourage people to come forward if they had a fever or other symptoms of Ebola.
He said it was necessary to introduce such stringent measures even though it was the festive season -  a time when people would normally ""celebrate with their families in a joyous manner"".
The president also said that:
Travel restrictions between districts would be enforced over the Christmas period
Christians would be allowed to attend church services, but would be requested to return home immediately afterwards
All New Year's Day festivities including church services and outings would be prohibited or severely restricted
In addition to the blanket Sunday trading ban, the new measures would include time restrictions on Saturday and weekday shopping.
The prevalence of the virus in the capital Freetown is thought to be one of the reasons why Ebola is spreading so fast in the west.
Our correspondent in Sierra Leone, Umaru Fofana, said the measures were partly aimed at controlling crowds.
He said people in Freetown continued to gather on the streets or go jogging along the beach despite the Ebola threat.
This is not the first time that Sierra Leone has used stringent tactics to locate Ebola sufferers, but none have stopped the rise in infections.
US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention head Tom Frieden told the AP news agency that ""the fight is going to be long and hard to get to zero cases"", and is heavily contingent on sick individuals coming forward to be diagnosed.

The world-famous Christ the Redeemer statue can be seen from Flamengo beach
Researchers in Brazil have discovered drug-resistant bacteria in the sea waters where sailing and windsurfing events will be held during the 2016 Olympics in Rio de Janeiro.
The ""super-bacteria"" are usually found in hospital waste and produce an enzyme, KPC, resistant to antibiotics.
Researchers found the bacteria in samples taken from Flamengo beach.
Nearly 70% of sewage in Rio - a city of some 10 million people - is spilled raw into the waters of Guanabara Bay.
The bacteria were found in samples taken from several locations along the Carioca river.
One sample was found at the point where the river flows into the bay on Flamengo beach.
Residents have been told to take extra care. Flamengo beach is frequently declared unfit for swimming, but many people disregard the official warnings.
'Not completely clean'
The superbug can cause urinary, gastrointestinal and pulmonary infections.
Samples taken from the mouth of the Carioca river on Flamengo beach had traces of the bacteria
Hundreds of millions of gallons of untreated sewage flow daily into Guanabara Bay
The government has built artificial beaches with clean water for Rio's poorer communities
""The problem is that in case of infection it is possible that treatment involves hospitalisation,"" said Ana Paula D'Alincourt Carvalho Assef, the study coordinator at Rio's renowned Oswaldo Cruz Institute.
""Since the super-bacteria are resistant to the most modern medications, doctors need to rely on drugs that are rarely used because they are toxic to the organism,"" she told the AP news agency.
In its Olympic bid, Rio promised to reduce pollution in Guanabara Bay by 80%.
But in June Rio Mayor Eduardo Paes admitted the target would not be met.
""I am sorry that we did not use the games to get Guanabara Bay completely clean,"" said Mr Paes.
The authorities say they understand athletes' concerns but insist that water pollution will not pose a major health risk during the Olympics, which will be held in August 2016.

A study by Cardiff surgeons has found what music works best when operating on patients
Music 'helps ventilator patients'
Stayin' Alive by the Bee Gees or Another One Bites the Dust by Queen? Cardiff surgeons have been looking at which songs work best for operations.
After a study of music and healing, Cardiff's University Hospital of Wales came up with a tongue-in-cheek list of what to play in theatre.
While classical music is preferred by most surgeons, some more current suggestions were put forward.
Sade's Smooth Operator was approved - but REM's Everybody Hurts is a no-no.
Some of the comical suggestions for songs to be played during surgery
Although the songs are only meant as a bit of festive fun from medical staff at the hospital, the benefits of music helping patients and surgeons alike stems from a legitimate study .
According to their findings, around 80% of theatre staff said music helped while carrying out operations.
They also found that music is played 62-72% of the time in the operating theatre, with songs often chosen by the lead surgeon.
'Like a surgeon'
Published in the Christmas issue of the British Medical Journal , theatre staff said music improved communication between staff, reduced anxiety and improved efficiency.
They also reported surgical performances were enhanced when music was played by increasing task focus - particularly among surgeons who listen to music regularly.
According to the report's authors, critics argue that music ""consumes cognitive bandwidth, reduces vigilance, impairs communication, and proves a distraction when anaesthetic problems are encountered"".
But they said they ""embrace music in the operating theatre whenever the situation allows it"".

"222","Huddles 'help children's hospital care'","Small measures that could boost children's care","Huddles 'help children's hospital care'
By Dr Peter Lachman Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health
Huddles can help
Exercise guidelines 'hard to meet'
It's good to talk, we're always told. And now child health expert Dr Peter Lachman says ""huddles"" - informal meetings of hospital staff - are a simple way of improving children's hospital care.
A lot can be said for good communication - it's a simple art which if done properly can build and maintain strong relationships, improve efficiency and most of all, improve outcomes.
Done badly, it can cause uncertainty and confusion.
In healthcare, good communication is essential if we are to ensure best practice and offer patients, regardless of postcode, access to safe, high quality care at the earliest opportunity.
Silos
Currently, coordination of care across the specialties is difficult and this can contribute to extended hospital stays and repeat admissions.
This places increased pressure on the NHS which simply isn't sustainable.
I'm not saying there is uncertainty in the health system, but there is still much more that can be done to improve care.
In paediatrics, there are many professionals working in silos which is preventing nurses, paediatricians and patients and parents themselves, working together effectively.
Although it sounds simple, it's actually complex to execute”
End Quote
As a consultant paediatrician, I know the value of working as part of a multi-professional team, drawing on the expertise of a range of colleagues and working in partnership with the child and family members to care for that child.
There must be a shift in attitude - from reaction to anticipation, otherwise we'll never dispel extended hospital stays and repeat admissions.
An intervention called the 'huddle' is one way of shifting this attitude.
It's a model pioneered in Cincinnati Children's Hospital around 12 months ago and one that has been adopted by a number of units in Scotland - to much praise by the Scottish Health Secretary, Alex Neil.
So what actually is it and why isn't it being used elsewhere in the UK?
Sickest children seen sooner
Thousands of sick children could be helped by 'simple changes'
The huddle and situation awareness are new concepts in healthcare and although it sounds simple, it's actually complex to execute - it's a change from the way people think and a change in culture.
The huddle is a short exchange of information between all involved in a patient's care.
It's a meeting which can be called by anyone, at any time to enhance 'situation awareness,' by offering a platform to openly discuss patient care with colleagues, determine which patients' need to be prioritised and what the best treatment is for them.
For example, at the start of my shift there might be 12 patients.

“Start Quote
The project aims to reduce avoidable error and harm of up to 4,000 acutely sick children by 2016 and involve parents and patients more in their care”
End Quote
The nurse and I call a 'huddle' -  three children have just returned to the ward following surgery and another child can actually be discharged.
However two other children need urgent attention. As a result, I see the urgent patients before seeing the other 10 children.
Not only does this mean the sickest children are identified earlier and subsequently get treated quicker, it also means they can get better and can leave hospital much sooner.
It also has huge benefits to the workforce as it allows skills to be enhanced through the sharing of best practice, performance to be sustained and consistent treatment delivered in hospitals regardless of postcode.
Better care hope
The Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, on behalf of the Situation Awareness for Everyone (S.A.F.E) partnership, received a cash injection from the Health Foundation of £450,000 to trial a number of quality improving techniques - including the huddle - at 12 hospital sites up and down the country.
Through the development of these techniques and enhanced communication between families, patients and professionals, the project aims to reduce avoidable error and harm of up to 4,000 acutely sick children by 2016 and involve parents and patients more in their care.
We estimate that this programme could reduce deterioration of children in paediatric wards by at least 50% and decrease serious outcomes by at least 10%.
We also believe that there will be a reduction in serious incidents and a culture shift from reactive responses to proactive prevention of harm.
If proven successful, there is scope for this model to be rolled out wider so it not only improves the care of children, but improves the care delivered to adults in the UK and beyond.

"223","Why 361 needles are better than one","Why 361 needles are better than one","Why 361 needles are better than one
By Roland Pease BBC Radio Science Unit
Many adults, as well as children, dislike needles
Is bushmeat behind Ebola outbreak?
One in 10 of us are said to have a fear of the hypodermic needle, a necessary but frequently uncomfortable fact of medical life.
While the needle is an efficient way to administer drugs and take samples for analysis, it still involves sticking a sharp bit of metal into the body.
This is problematic for many children, but particularly premature babies.
Since they are typically ill, premature babies are given a lot of medicines. But, because of their vulnerability, doctors need to take frequent blood samples as to ensure they get the right dose.
This could come in the form of regular injections, or the insertion of a permanent cannula, a procedure which is difficult enough to administer in grown adults.
'Like a cat's tongue'
Many researchers have tried to find an alternative solution.
Now, Prof Ryan Donnelly from Queens University Belfast and his team think they have come up with a solution. Not one needle, but 361.
The device looks like a small, clear plastic patch about half a centimetre across, which easily sits on the tip of your finger. One side looks quite rough.
Microneedle patch compared to traditional needle
""It's a patch with 361 tiny, individual needles on it,"" explains Prof Donnelly.
The patch feels slightly rough to the touch, something akin to Velcro or a cats tongue. But the individual needles are extremely hard, and sharp at the tips.
Unlike normal hypodermic needles, these microneedles only penetrate the top layer of your skin. They don't contact the nerves, which is why you feel no pain. Nor do they go into your blood vessels.
Instead they collect the so called interstitial fluid which surrounds the cells in the outer layer of skin.
This fluid contains all the information the doctor requires.
'Very distressed'
It's always worse for the parents - you don't want to see your child getting stabbed”
End Quote Sofie Backstrom Mother of a premature baby
""Quite often they'll need to have their blood monitored four times a day. If we can use these microneedles instead, we don't have to take any blood at all.""
Dr Brady adds: ""There are real problems associated with hypodermic needles, such as scarring and bruising.
""Using microneedles instantly eliminates any issues with scaring, bruising and damage to tissue.""
Parents are very much in favour of something that could be applied as easily as a sticking plaster because, as Prof Ryan says, they become ""very distressed"" by the invasive medical procedures their children have to be subjected to.
Sofie Backstrom's daughter Freja has just turned one, but she was born three months prematurely at 26 weeks.
""When she was born she had blood samples taken almost daily for the first three months,"" says Sofie.
She still has injection scars from that time.
""They're mainly on the back of her hands and feet but on her knees and elbows too - about 20 scars on each.""
Sofie would have welcomed a pain-free alternative.
""I think it's always worse for the parents - you don't want to see your child getting stabbed.""
Drug delivery
Plastic patch promises pain free injections
Prof Donnelly and his team aren't the only ones developing an alternative to injections. Several groups around the world are working on similar technologies, including Linda Klavinskis, an immunobiologist from Kings College London.
Microneedles can also be used for drug delivery and she is very excited about their potential. ""One of the most profound effects will be the ability to deliver vaccines at a reduced cost.
""Microneedles are very simple, you don't need specially trained staff and they won't need any of the paraphernalia of a conventional vaccine.""
Compounds can be incorporated into the polymer patches when they are made, and are slowly released into the body once they come into contact with the interstitial fluid.
Keeping cool
Prof Donnelly's team have used the patches to administer everything from insulin to ibuprofen.
Microneedles could also do away with the need to refrigerate vaccines.
Most vaccines need to be kept cold to stay effective and to prevent bacterial growth.
Trapped inside the polymer patches the vaccines should be stable in a dry state, even at warm temperatures.
It makes the needles particularly useful for vaccination campaigns in remote areas, where delivering and storing conventional liquid vaccines can be a challenge.
Prof Donnelly  says: ""Up to 50% of vaccines do not work in the developing world, because they've inadvertently been allowed to warm beyond 38C, or they've been frozen by mistake, which can damage the vaccine."".
If a patient receives a vaccine that hasn't been refrigerated properly it may not work and could lead to septicaemia and even death.

The UK has announced plans to be the first country to allow a technique which helps prevent genetic disease and produces so-called ""three parent babies"".
It helps prevent diseases caused by genetic faults in the mitochondria, which are found in human cells and generate energy.
The nucleus of the fertilised egg is removed from the cell and put into an egg cell from another women, which has healthy mitochondria.
It can help prevent some fatal genetic disorders but has generated some controversy.

With old age comes the increasing likelihood of memory loss. But when should we worry, asks Joan Bakewell.
Getting old just happens of course.  It creeps up on you when you aren't looking and suddenly you're forgetting names and losing keys.  At once alarm bells ring -  could this be the first indication of dementia?
I am in my 80s now and I would be foolish not to consider whether these irritating incidents are more than simple forgetfulness.  I console myself - wasn't I always forgetful, without taking it as a sign of something significant?
When I mentioned the problem to my novelist friend Malcolm Bradbury, he sympathised. ""But Joan, you and I have stuffed our brains full throughout our lives, we shouldn't be surprised if some of it begins to fall off the shelf."" I felt better, and carried on being randomly forgetful.

But now the argument has quickened.  Dementia is growing in its impact as we all live longer lives. It's reckoned there are more than 800,000 sufferers in the UK. When and how will I know if I am one of them?
It's estimated 61% of people worry that they may be afflicted in the future - that number rises to 66% for the over 55s.  At least I am not alone.  Indeed I am among friends.
I have known the actors Timothy West and his wife Prunella Scales for four decades. If we aren't exactly in and out of each other's houses, we certainly go to each other's parties, exchange Christmas cards and rejoice in the successes of children and, more recently, grandchildren.
Over the past year they together have decided to go public on the fact that Pru has dementia.
It first began with lines. Pru has had a distinguished career for over 50 years. She has starred in some of television's most popular series: Marriage Lines, opposite Richard Briers, After Henry, Mapp and Lucia, and of course, as Sybil Fawlty in Fawlty Towers.   About 15 years ago she began to notice it was getting harder to remember lines.  She put it down to age.
Her last stage appearance was five years ago in Carrie's War in the West End.  Of course, work continues with voiceovers which she can still handle with her usual flair and aplomb. But their doctor indicated that her condition would get worse.  It is getting worse, but only slowly.
I enter their home exactly as I know it, full of welcome and laughter, cups of tea and theatre gossip. But there are differences - a huge whiteboard in the kitchen lists in order the things Pru will be doing that day.  A trained helper, Meegan, familiar with the progression of dementia, has moved in to live with them.  She goes about her caring with a tactful absence of fuss.
We sit and talk about the how much their lives are affected and it becomes clear there are two narratives here. Pru complains of occasionally forgetting things - ""but then I am 82 years old - surely that's allowed"".
But she is shocked when Tim explains how at a party Pru will tell someone the same anecdote time after time. ""Oh, I don't do that do I? Surely not. Oh how dreadful."" I hear in her outrage the familiar response of the Pru I know. But her response is characteristic of the denial which is common among dementia sufferers.
What is dementia?

Source: Alzheimer's society , BBC Science
The fact is dementia is changing her and their lives together, but as in the best of marriages it is a shift rather than a catastrophe. Tim clearly feels the loss - when they go out for the evening together they both enjoy the event,  but once back home Pru can't talk about it because it has already slipped from her memory.
I leave for home reflecting on how several friends of my generation are now drifting into this unknown world. I wonder about my own forgetfulness and decide it is, so far as I can tell, of a quite different order.  Nonetheless it is evident enough for me to take small avoiding steps -  sticky notes left around the house,  a notepad beside the bed, a list of things to do each day.
But then didn't I do that already when the overload of my busy life threatened to engulf me? I have been a journalist for over 40 years, working in different media and keeping tabs on what I do through well-ordered and sometime scruffy diaries, shelves of files and dependence on the support of agents and editors.   The agents and editors might well say their support has got stronger in recent months.  I happily take for granted their loyalty and friendship.  A network of obligations that keeps me busy and committed is keeping me on track. If dementia looms, I simply haven't time to notice.
Nonetheless what I've been learning about early intervention, the memory clinics, the ongoing research, is enough to persuade me that staying alert for symptoms and confronting fears early is the best way to grow old. I know I shall be taking those memory tests one day soon.
The UK is only now gearing up to meet the enormous challenge dementia presents for the future. There will always be a struggle for resources and new skills. If individuals can help with their own diagnoses, rather than hide away from bad news, then that will help.
There's no denying the harrowing experience of families whose members no longer know who they are. But my friends Tim and Pru have shown me that there can still sometimes be happiness and laughter to be got out of life.

"234","Why are hospitals under so much pressure?","Why are hospitals under so much pressure this winter?","Why are hospitals under so much pressure?
Joined-up care: The elephant in the room
You need look no further than Salford Royal Hospital to realise the point the NHS has got to.
The trust is generally regarded as one of the best - if not the best - in the UK. It outperforms its counterparts on a whole host of measures from patient satisfaction to waiting times.
But last week it missed the four-hour A&E waiting time target - dipping below the 95% standard by the narrowest of margins. This is not a quirk. It's been dragged down along with the rest of the hospital sector.
Once you strip out the small units and walk-in centres, where the pressure is less intense, seven out of eight of England's 141 major units are now missing the target.
If this sort of performance continues for the rest of the month, the quarterly results for October to December will be the worst since the target was introduced in 2004.
Performance levels in Wales and Northern Ireland are even lower (Scotland seems to be performing at a similar level to England, although as the data there lags behind the other parts of the UK, it is hard to say for sure).
This is despite ministers in all four corners of the UK handing the health service extra money to deal with winter pressures.
How performance compares in UK
Nation
Using #nhswinter on Twitter
But what is interesting as you delve down into the data is that it's not just A&E units that are finding it difficult - there are pressure points across the whole system.
Nearly a fifth of patients who go to A&E need to be admitted into the hospital for more complex care than can be given in an emergency department. Sometimes they face long waits (classed as over four hours) before a bed can be found for them. These are known as ""trolley waits"".
The latest weekly figures show they topped 7,000. That is the highest since weekly collections began in 2010.
But hospitals are also finding it difficult to discharge patients. The figures for September , the last full month for which they are available, were at their highest since that data set began in 2010.
A significant factor in this is the squeeze on councils' social care budgets. Many of the patients who end up in hospital are frail and elderly, and when they are ready to be released need support in the community to get back on their feet. If it's not there, they have to stay in hospital, which occupies a bed often needed for other patients.
Another pressure point is at the other end of the system - before the visit to hospital is made. Both the Royal College of GPs and British Medical Association have been vocal about the workload their members are facing.
A recent BMA survey found three quarters of doctors said their caseload was ""unsustainable"" - and that seems to have started impacting on patients, as latest data from the official NHS England patient survey shows they are finding it more difficult to get an appointment.
If GPs are unable to keep pace with demand, the obvious place patients turn to is A&E.
To be fair to ministers across the UK, they have recognised this. Wales, Scotland and England have all published plans in the last 18 months to relieve the pressure on the urgent and emergency care systems.
But these are all long-term solutions. In the short-term, all eyes are on what happens this winter.
So what next? ""Predictions are very hard to make,"" says Chris Hopson, of NHS Providers, which represents hospitals. ""What we don't know is what will happen with Norovirus or flu. Services are so stretched at the moment, that all it will take is a spike in those to make it very difficult for us.""
It seems to be the case that despite all the planning, all the money, and all the hard work of NHS staff, this winter will hinge on factors outside everyone's control.

A night on Norwich's SOS bus
19 December 2014 Last updated at 00:00 GMT
Towns and cities across the UK are in peak Christmas party season.
Friday 19 December has been dubbed Mad Friday as it marks the start of one of the busiest weekends of the year for ambulance services and hospitals as thousands of revellers hit bars and clubs.
In Norwich, the SOS Bus is a year-round service that helps people suffering the effects of too much alcohol or otherwise in distress during a night out.
Run by volunteers, and with the support of an NHS Paramedic, the service helps take the pressure off the ambulance service and A&E by providing a safe place.
As they geared up for one of the busiest times of the year, BBC News spent a night on board.

Schoolgirls Leah Doak (left) and Claire Stevenson (right) are both carers for their mothers. They are pictured above during a support session at West Norfolk Carers
While nobody sets out to be an unpaid carer, it is a job more than six million people currently perform, according to the 2011 Census. This hidden workforce, thought to save the economy £119bn a year, is drawn from all ages and backgrounds.
Here are a few of their stories.
Gill
Continue reading the main story
""You'll be listening to the radio on a Friday and somebody will say 'hey, it's nearly the weekend' or 'the weekend's nearly here',"" says Gill West, who is a full time carer for her father George. ""And? That makes absolutely no difference to carers. Carers don't have weekends.""
George, 86, has Alzheimer's Disease and vascular dementia. He and Gill live in Harrow, north-west London.
In the three-and-a-half years that Gill - previously a human resources project consultant - has cared for her father, she has had just 10 days off.
""I now have a very different life,"" she says. ""It is tough and it is difficult.
""When you meet up with your 'normal' friends you realise they are all living 'normally' - they might be talking about a promotion or a holiday or a new purchase. My whole world is caring.
""When you meet with other carers you can have a laugh about the things that happen in our daily lives.""
As well as setting up a number of coffee mornings for carers, Gill, using her HR skills, has also developed her own courses to help new carers.
""I felt lost and isolated when I started out on my caring journey and wanted to help others, something positive to make my journey more worthwhile.""
Rachel and Anjeli
Trevor, Rachel and Anjeli Diack
Rachel and Anjeli Diack's mother has multiple sclerosis.
""Our dad (Trevor) does most of the caring"", says Anjeli, 12, of King's Lynn, Norfolk. ""But he works full time and we are needed to help out.
""In the last six months we have done more and more caring for mum and also lots more cleaning up and tidying up in the house because mum can't do things like that anymore.
""We help with her medication too, which is sometimes difficult to get right with all the different tablets she needs to take every day.""
Shivakuru and Meenadchyammah
(L to R) Shivakuru,  Meenadchyammah and Anutha Selvathurai live in a small small ground floor flat in Harrow
Shivakuru Selvathurai removes his spectacles to wipe the tears from his eyes. A Tamil refugee, he has been describing the horrors of the Sri Lankan civil war he witnessed first hand.
He, his wife Meenadchyammah and their daughter Anutha fled in 2001. They lived first in Liverpool and then in Harrow.
Shivakuru, 70, knows better than most the polarities of violence and kindness of which human beings are capable. Anutha, 37, has profound learning difficulties and needs round-the-clock care.
Yet Anutha's considerable needs are dwarfed by Shivakuru and Meenadchyammah's need to give. Not just to their daughter, but to the wider community.
""We have needed so much help,"" he says, ""with our housing problems, language difficulties with the authorities, getting the right support from health service providers and money advice for our daughter who has some intensive and pressing needs.
""We are so very grateful to the UK Government and the British people generally.""
Shivakuru has been a residents group champion, he volunteers for the NHS, the Royal British Legion, the Army Benevolent Fund and other charities. He is a multiple recipient of the Harrow Heroes Volunteer Award.
Why does he do it? The answer, he says, is that when he and his family were in desperate need, the UK provided them with sanctuary. His role now, he says, is to give something back.
Ronnie and Roger
Ronnie and Roger Lewis sat at Ronnie's craft table
Ronnie Lewis struggles to speak. ""Some days I can't stop crying,"" she says.
Before her first severe stroke a decade ago, Ronnie, who lives beside a busy carriageway in west Norfolk, was an avid artist.
She still has her bright and airy studio, the walls lined with box upon box of arts and crafts material. But now even the simplest of tasks - such as gluing small feathers to a piece of paper - takes enormous effort.
""And some days I'm so tired I cannot get out of bed.""
Two further strokes followed that first one 10 years ago. Her husband, Roger, a former publican, is her carer.
""There is not much time for anything besides being a carer,"" he says. ""I do like to potter around our garden and I still nurture the idea of doing some more wine-making again one day.""
Mukesh
Mukesh Maroo is in the unusual situation of being both a carer for his elderly mother and needing a carer himself after undergoing  major knee surgery
""For me, being a carer is a blessing,"" says 49-year-old Mukesh Maroo.
Mukesh arrived in the UK from Kenya at the age of 10. While his late father ran a successful business in the UK, he believes the ""shock"" of emigrating - the ""longing for home"" and a sense of ""isolation"" - had a profound and lasting effect on his mother, for whom he is a primary carer.
In the aftermath of major knee surgery, Mukesh, himself a successful businessman, now finds himself both a carer and a recipient of care.
Mukesh, who lives in Harrow, says caring brings people back to fundamental needs - of loving, being loved, of giving and asking for the help of others.
""Too many people are almost 'cocooned' from each other - what we all need to again do is switch on our ability to care, by lessening our suspicions of each other,"" he says.
Jackie
Jackie Haverson went for the first night out with her husband in four years. A mere 30 minutes had passed before the couple were called home.
For most of us, booking a holiday has become a simple series of steps, clicking boxes on a website and entering payment details.
Not so for Jackie Haverson, who lives with her husband and two disabled daughters in King's Lynn.
One daughter has epilepsy and dyspraxia, the other attention deficit disorder.
""When we book a hotel abroad we have to check what type of lights they use (because some can trigger an epileptic fit), where the nearest hospital is, how we might get to that hospital if we need it, how busy it is, what disabled facilities they have and so on,"" she says.
""We have to plan everything strategically and do it so far ahead. But we do it because we want our girls to enjoy their childhood.""
A few weeks ago, Jackie and her husband went out for their first drink together in about four years. After half an hour, the babysitter - who knows the daughters well - found she could not cope with their needs.
""We didn't even finish our drinks.""

By Stephen Evans BBC News, Seoul
Christingle: The Christmas tradition that only got going in the 1960s
You can't avoid the adverts. Everywhere you go in Seoul, you are urged to change your shape through plastic surgery. In affluent Gangnam, every wall seems to have a sign pointing to a surgery.
On the train and in the street, you're told you can ""bring your face to life"". ""Facial contouring"" is on offer - ""breast surgery"", ""anti-ageing"", ""eyeplasty"", ""body contouring"". There is ""square jaw reduction"" (mainly, the adverts imply, for men). Or transforming your face ""from saggy and loose to elastic and dimensional"", targeted mostly at women.
One acquaintance of mine complains that her chin becomes painful when it rains. And then it emerges that she went into the surgery for a nose job but got persuaded - or persuaded herself - that it was her chin that really needed its contours changing. The result: a more shapely chin that is also a more painful chin. Despite that, she is now intent on breast enlargement.
This is not a human face - it is more revolting than monsters or aliens”
End Quote
In this country, parents tell me that they give their teenage daughters a present of what's called ""double eyelid surgery"" which makes eyes more pronounced - ""less Asian"" is the truth of it. Why, I wonder, when Korean eyes seem so beautiful the way they are?
The retort that blares from the adverts on the train is that ""confidence in appearance brings positive energy which can be the foundation of happiness"". Happiness - so easily found at the cut of a knife!
Except that, of course, it's not. There is now a backlash, a slew of court cases where patients - or victims as they might be known - are suing doctors who re-arranged their faces, but not in a good way. One victim said when the bandages came off: ""This is not a human face. It is more revolting than monsters or aliens.""
Kim Bok-Soon was persuaded to spend 30m Won (£17,320) for 15 surgeries on her face
Part of the problem is that plastic surgery is so lucrative that unqualified doctors have been drawn in - or rather doctors qualified in other areas of quite different medicine. It's alleged that procedures have been done by what are called ""ghost doctors"". In one court case, it's claimed that the advertised doctor slipped out of the operating room once the patient was under the anaesthetic and the job was then botched by the replacement surgeon.
On top of that, it's emerged that some before-and-after photos have had a bit of surgery themselves - surgery of the Photoshop variety.
The upshot is that the Korean Association of Plastic Surgeons has called for tighter rules for doctors and for advertisers. They fear that the bad publicity is damaging the reputation of an industry which is largely well-run.
But they're fighting against the tide. Plastic surgery is very profitable, even with prices that undercut the US and Europe. One of the big businesses in Gangnam, here in Seoul, prices ""eye-shape correction"" at 1.7m Korean Won. That's about £1,000 ($1,500) for a 30-minute, simple procedure. It rises to 12m Won for a ""full-incision face lift"" - that's about £7,000 ($11,000).
South Korea plastic surgery
In response to a survey of 1,000 patients, run by the Korea Consumer Agency (KCA):
70% of those questioned said they had a surgical procedure to improve their looks, and 14.5% said they believed it boosted their prospects for employment or promotion
The most popular procedure was the ""double-eyelid surgery"" - 67.8% of respondents said they undergone the procedure
32.3% of those asked responded that the results of their procedures were ""unsatisfactory""
Plastic surgery is like an addiction - if you do the eyes, you want the nose”
End Quote
Translation is increasingly needed. There's a big market with a similar sense of vanity right on Korea's doorstep: China. According to the reputable Joongang Daily here, two-thirds of the foreigners who came for plastic surgery to South Korea last year were from China, more than 16,000 customers. The press here says that some of the procedures have been so radical - so successful - that passport officials have not believed it's the same person holding the passport.
But maybe Chinese people who aspire to film-star beauty or, for that matter, South Korean parents who think they can improve their daughters through the surgeon's knife should reflect on one horror story going through the courts.
A former beauty queen here had breast enhancement which went horribly wrong. After a series of infections, she ended up with one breast much bigger than the other.
She blames doctors for the medical failure but also for never saying to her: ""Look, you don't need this."" ""Plastic surgery is like an addiction,"" she said. ""If you do the eyes, you want the nose.
""And doctors don't say, 'You're beautiful enough as you are.'""
Ji Yeo's photographs were first published as part of a series called Beauty Recovery Room

Dr Kevin Mortimer explains his hopes for the Cooking and Pneumonia Study
Is bushmeat behind Ebola outbreak?
An estimated three billion people breathe in poisonous smoke from open-fire cooking, killing more than four million every year. In Malawi, a research team is conducting the largest-ever study on children into the effects of indoor smoke and hopes its results will save millions of young lives, as our science reporter, Victoria Gill, discovered.
Ennere's eyes are watering. Smoke from the fire she is cooking on is filling her tiny, one-room house in a small village in the district of Chikwawa in the south of Malawi.
It is a traditional open fire on the floor of her hut, surrounded by three bricks to keep in the hot embers and on which to rest her cooking pot.
She and her two-year old daughter, who is gripping Ennere's shoulder as she crouches over a warming pan of water, are breathing in the smoke.
Most of the small houses here have no chimney. Some of the smoke escapes through the doorway, but there is no other ventilation. Smoke is filling the little girl's lungs.
We're interested in counting cases of pneumonia. We don't want to count dead children”
End Quote Dr Kevin Mortimer Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine
This happens every time Ennere cooks.
Like 95% of people in Malawi, her family belong to what the World Health Organization calls the ""forgotten three billion "", people who have to breathe polluted air in their homes and are being poisoned by their own cooking fires.
""Smoke basically clogs up children's lungs making them more susceptible to infections like pneumonia, explains Dr Kevin Mortimer, one of the lead researchers from the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine .
In Malawi, pneumonia is the number one killer of children under five.
According to the WHO, throughout sub-Saharan Africa, almost one million children every year die from the disease.  Worldwide that number could be more than four million.
The stove being tested in this cooking-and-pneumonia trial has a battery-operated fan beneath the furnace
Redesigning the stove on which millions cook, the researchers believe, could be the solution to cutting this death toll.
There are several different types of clean cook stove. The ones the team are testing use the same fuel as open fires, wood (or biomass) but they incorporate a battery-powered fan that blows air through a contained furnace.
This produces a more efficient, less smoky fire.
The Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine team intends to distribute 16,000 stoves in the north of Malawi, and here in Chikwawa in the south. It will be the largest trial of its type ever undertaken anywhere in the world.
Ennere and her daughter have been recruited to the control group, meaning they will continue to use conventional cooking methods over a traditional open fire.
That might seem unfair, but it will allow researchers to compare their ""stove intervention"" with routine, smoky cooking practices.
At the end of the two-year study, during which the researchers will monitor the health of each child, every family involved will receive two of the cleaner, ""advanced-burning"" stoves.
One in every hundred children in Malawi dies from pneumonia before the age of five
If this team finds that the stoves they are testing prevent pneumonia, Dr Mortimer says this will be a definitive message for Malawi's government, and policymakers around the world, that this is a priority for their investment.
The 9,000th child
At the nearby Chikwawa District Hospital, the toll that lung disease takes here becomes clear.
Chifundo Ndamala is one of the clinical staff working for the research project, providing care for children involved in the study, as well as recording and tracking every case of pneumonia.
As Dr Mortimer puts it: ""We're interested in counting cases of pneumonia, not dead children.""
For that reason, the team has employed health workers and invested in diagnostic tools and antibiotics, so every child in the study has access to the treatment they need if they do become ill.
Chifundo is attending to one of the children from the control group - a young boy of about two.
He smiles warmly at the little boy as he examines him, but the toddler is wide-eyed and clings to his mother as they sit together on the bare mattress of the hospital bed.
""He was diagnosed with severe pneumonia three months ago,"" Chifundo tells me. ""But he's doing well, he's responding to treatment now.""
Mothers stay to care for their children at Chikwawa's district hospital
This is a country where healthcare is basic - there are approximately 50,000 people for every doctor in Malawi. And staff here in the children's ward have to work with the few resources they have to care for their young patients, some of whom are critically ill.
But this project does mean that Chifundo is on hand to help.
""This is not a place of comfort,"" says Dr Mortimer, ""but it is a place where people are doing their utmost to provide the best possible care with the resources they have.""
Chifundo is even more optimistic.
""We're able to treat children who will be the leaders of this nation one day,"" he says.
""It's rewarding job; just seeing a child recover and go home, it's good for the soul.""
Dr Mortimer also hopes the study and the eventual publication of its findings will ""raise the profile"" of indoor smoke exposure.
""People should know,"" he says, ""that this is a condition that causes millions of deaths every year"".

Bill against 'privatised' NHS backed
NHS patients who get referred to private hospitals for two very common surgeries enjoy better results, Newsnight analysis has shown.
Looking at knee and hip replacements, the only two procedures for which there is enough data, Newsnight found patients referred to private providers did better than patients of the same age, gender and prior health who were referred to NHS hospitals.
The analysis uses a dataset called ""Proms"", which stands for "" patient reported outcome measures "".
This is an unusual set of records which sets out to record how well patients feel. They respond to a detailed questionnaire about their health before an operation, then afterwards.
By comparing the two sets of results, we can benchmark - in detail - how well providers paid similar sums of money did in improving the lot of patients.
Proms also contains results for two other categories: groin hernia repair and varicose veins.
Analysis of both of these categories of care found that the private providers did better, too, but that the quantities of data are too small for the analysis to be reliable.
After conducting regression analyses of the survey data, we can demonstrate how this affects patients.
Take, for example, a hypothetical 70 year-old who reported that they had a low score on the general wellbeing measure on Proms - 50 out of 100 - because they need a hip replacement.
If they were to go to a public hospital they could expect a score after surgery of 78.9 out of 100.
At a private one, it would be 83.9 out of 100 - a gap of five points. For a similar patient seeking a knee replacement, the private-public gap would be around 3.4 points.
'Puzzle on provision'
In both cases, the results are highly statistically significant.
Since we have adjusted for gender, age and prior condition of the patient, we can say the difference is not explained by the slightly simpler set of cases that private providers tend to take on.
But remember that while, en masse, private providers may tend to do better than public ones, individual NHS providers may beat individual private ones.
And this is only a small part of the puzzle on provision inside the NHS: it covers just two operations for a single year (albeit common ones).
There is, furthermore, existing academic research that suggests that specialist providers doing a few elective treatments often do beat the pack. This may explain it.
Still: Watch this space.
As the amount of NHS provision that is outsourced has drifted up since the early 2000s, we will probably find other areas where new (and that might often mean private) providers tend to do better than legacy NHS hospitals.
Conversely, we will also confirm that there areas where patients report that traditional NHS providers are best. They have unique variety of services on-site.
If we can get more data which gives us good information on care quality we can, one hopes, work out which is which.
"
"240","Interesting NHS data no-one is looking at","Chris Cooks reflects on the NHS data no-one appears to be viewing","Interesting NHS data no-one is looking at
Last week, John Appleby, chief economist at the King's Fund, wrote a cry of help.
One of the most interesting and important set of statistics in the NHS is being neglected. And he's right to be annoyed.
The statistics - known as proms - are respected, cheap to collect and provide useful information.
But, since their initial proof of concept, he says, their use has progressed ""barely at all"".
I, for one, think this is a terrible shame because they - uniquely in the health service - relate to real care quality.
Proms stands for ""patient reported outcome measures"".
Fancier stuff
Before some of the more popular forms of elective surgery, patients fill in a form explaining how they feel.
Then, after the operation, they fill them in again. Using that, we can say who is good at getting patients to feel better.
Why is this so important?
Well, most statistics on this kind of care are about mortality. Quite often, we struggle to say more than ""well, they didn't die"".
But using proms, we can very easily see whether care quality is rising. And we can also do fancier stuff.
For example, we can see whether GPs - newly empowered by the Andrew Lansley reforms - now commission more operations from very good providers and fewer from the very bad.
If his market-based reforms are working, they should be.
So far, that is not very apparent.
The share of hip replacement operations commissioned from good providers rose marginally from 10.2% to 11.5% in 2013-14 - the first year of the reforms.
But it did not fall at the worst providers, sticking at about 10%.
That is actually a very tiny amount better than before the reforms - but we'll have to wait to see if we get any significant movement.
We can also see evidence of excess treatment within proms.
Overtreatment means unnecessary surgery and drugs. It's both expensive and genuinely terrible for patients.
For example, take hernias - that's when muscles near your groin tear, allowing a portion of your intestines to poke through.
It is a condition that affects men, in particular. There were 60,000 groin hernia repair operations in England in 2013-14.
It has historically been treated with surgery - usually by shoving a small piece of plastic mesh between the muscles and intestine.
Unneeded treatment
The principal idea is to prevent dangerous complications known as ""strangulation"" or ""obstruction"".
But that is now reckoned rare for men with few symptoms.
In 2006, the Journal of the American Medical Association advised that ""watchful waiting"" was advised for men ""with asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic"" hernias.
Yet according to proms, about a fifth of hernia repairs are for men who report no or minimal discomfort on the proms test.
Furthermore, 85% of them report feeling worse after the treatment.
That's about £50m of possibly unneeded treatment right there, hidden in a survey.
Tim Hughes, a doctor at Kirkbymoorside in Yorkshire, has recently been using proms to encourage hernia patients to consider whether they really need their treatment - and most decide not to have it.
We should be watching proms to see how that progresses in the coming years.
'Cherry picking'
We can also use proms to see whether private providers operating inside the NHS are ""cherry picking"" - that is to say, getting easier patients.
Because the NHS has an inflexible pricing structure, they often get as much money for treating easy cases as slightly harder ones.
You can use proms to do more sophisticated analysis, but - for a start - the average groin hernia repair patient, at the average NHS provider, has a health score of 77 out of 100.
At private providers, it's 81.
That's not much, but enough to say they do tend to take slightly easier cases.
But the private providers also do slightly better by them, since the improvement in scores tends to be a bit higher at the private providers.
They get an average improvement of 8.8 points. For state providers, it's 7.8.
Proms is perhaps the most interesting data on the NHS that no-one is looking at.
Given how sterile much of our discussion of the health service is, Prof Appleby is right: that's a real shame.

"241","Suicide 'not always inevitable'","Spotlight on one woman's efforts to help prevent suicide","Suicide prevention is 'everybody's business'
By Jane Dreaper Health correspondent, BBC News
James Wentworth-Stanley, who took his own life at the age of 21, pictured with his mother Clare Milford Haven
'First aid' suicide prevention course
The death of Charlotte Bevan and her newborn daughter in Bristol has prompted a review into the care she was given.
There are often questions about how such tragic situations might be avoided when family and friends become aware that a loved one is slipping into a decline.
To talk about this most sensitive of subjects, I met a polo player and former social editor at Tatler magazine, Clare Milford Haven, for a coffee in a quiet cafe at Brighton railway station.
Her eldest son, James Wentworth-Stanley, was sporty, bright and good-looking.
He took his own life at the age of just 21 in 2006.
He was in his second year of studying Spanish and business.
Described by his mother as ""a doer"", he also played in a rugby team and held down a hotel bar job.
James had returned to student life in Newcastle a few days after a minor operation had led to a change in mood.
'Horrendous and alarming'
Clare Milford Haven told me: ""I wish I'd kept him under my watchful eye.
""I couldn't force his hand about returning to Newcastle - but I regret it, because then he took his own life.
""It was the most horrendous and alarming experience.
""There was absolutely no warning sign at all - we didn't see it coming. Our world was turned upside down.
""You have so many questions, and you just look for answers.
""A suicide bereavement is complicated by intense feelings of guilt and shame.""
James Wentworth-Stanley sought help, in vain. He had been in contact with a GP, and a walk-in centre - which sent him to A&E two days before his suicide.
His mother has harnessed her pain to help others.
Clare Milford Haven helps to run the Alliance of Suicide Prevention Charities (TASC).
Sometimes rules of confidentiality mean people don't get the help they might need ”
End Quote Chris Brown Grassroots Suicide Prevention
One of her goals is to set up a network of centres near hospitals.
Called James' Place, these would offer urgent face-to-face support for patients who are experiencing a crisis but are not in touch with mental health services.
Clare hopes the idea will be piloted in West London as well as in Brighton and Hove.
She said: ""We'd like to have a hierarchy of staff - from volunteers to highly trained clinicians. But the atmosphere would be a non-clinical one.
""It's my dream that this would fill those very vital gaps in services.""
We drive to a nearby library, where 11 people have gathered for a course called Safe Talk, or ""Suicide Alertness For Everyone"".
The audience - mostly community workers - watch and discuss video clips which demonstrate how to ask someone who is suffering a very simple but direct question: ""Could you be thinking of suicide?""
The message behind the course is the importance of keeping someone who is  vulnerable safe, and connecting them with services.
This might involve, for example, taking someone to a pharmacist or GP with any medicine they have stockpiled.
'People have doubts'
During a break, the instructor Chris Brown tells me how the charity she co-founded, Grassroots Suicide Prevention, is working to reduce what had been a very high suicide rate in Brighton.
She said: ""We're trying to make Brighton a 'suicide-safe' town - it's all about education, awareness and training residents with brief courses like this one.
""Research tells us that people considering suicide have doubts about it. It shouldn't be regarded as an inevitable outcome.
""Part of a person considering ending their life wants to live, as well as the part of them that wants to die.
""But sometimes rules of confidentiality can mean that people don't get the help they might need from friends or family - this can result in a tragic outcome.""
Advice to doctors from the Medical Defence Union says they should encourage patients to allow friends and family to get involved - and they can listen to the concerns of loved ones.
Technology could hold some promise here - Grassroots has launched an app called Stay Alive, which aims to point desperate people to help quickly.
But the Samaritans had to suspend their app called Radar, after criticism that its monitoring of tweets was intrusive and could encourage bullies.
This is an area in which any support has to be offered carefully and sensitively.

By Anna Bradley Chair of Healthwatch England
The NHS should welcome reports from 'third parties', Ms Bradley says
Exercise guidelines 'hard to meet'
People who see something going wrong in the NHS should be able to report their concerns, even if they haven't been directly affected, according to Anna Bradley, the chair of patients' group Healthwatch England.
In this week's Scrubbing Up, she says the NHS often doesn't let witnesses file complaints - an omission akin to preventing people reporting an abandoned bag at an airport because they don't have the owner's permission.
We know that patients are reluctant to make a fuss when standards slip on hospital wards.
Many simply don't know how to make a complaint, others are actually scared of the consequences.
Yet we often hear complaints referred to as 'gold dust' by hospital bosses in terms of improving services.
You would think then that health and care organisations would be eager to hear from anyone who wanted to report a concern or complaint.
However, our research suggests that tens of thousands of incidents are slipping under the radar because those who witness poor care and try to report it are being told, in one particular case, to ""mind their own business"".
'Civic-minded individuals'
Responding to a Freedom of Information request, a third of hospitals across England told us that they don't record complaints from ""third parties"", ie those that witness rather than personally experiencing poor care.
Many of the hospital trusts that replied incorrectly stated that such complaints cannot be investigated without the permission of the patient.

Others said they record such incidents as informal feedback only, with no follow-up provided to the courageous and civic minded individuals complaining on behalf of vulnerable patients.
In the worst cases some hospitals just flat out said they don't record these complaints.
Even where these reports are recorded, they are often not included in formal stats allowing hospitals so their complaints data doesn't tell the true story.
For me this is symptomatic of a much bigger problem around complaints handling in the NHS and social care services.
The fact that doctors and nurses would rather tell one of these ""citizen whistleblowers"" they can't complain because they don't tick the right box or have the permission to make a complaint is just wrong.
If a passer-by reports an abandoned bag in an airport, the staff don't say: ""I'm sorry sir, but do you have the permission of the bag owner."" Rather they are thanked for their vigilance.
If the policy makers and politicians are serious about driving culture change in the NHS then more needs to be done to wipe out this 'compute says no' attitude and encourage staff to welcome feedback - positive and negative.
'Long hard look'
With the secretary of state for health's update on progress against the recommendations of the Francis inquiry expected in the next few weeks, I implore him to take a long hard look at the complaints question.
In our report, 'Suffering in Silence', we set out a vision for streamlining and refocusing the complaints system around what people want.
Firstly, the system needs to make it easier for people to complain, including institutions understanding that everyone, including third parties, has the right to raise concerns.
Secondly, every case should be dealt with compassionately, with a speedy, personalised response that actually addresses the poor experience and includes an outline of what happens next.
Lastly, those who fail to up their game must be held to account by being put into ""special measures"" by the regulators, issued with financial penalties and ultimately being shut down and replaced.
In short, it's time for the health and social care sector to get serious about complaints, and stop finding loopholes to avoid having to face up to their mistakes.

"243","Phillip Hughes: How is the brain injured?","How the brain is protected and injured","Phillip Hughes: How is the brain injured?
By James Gallagher & Philippa Roxby Health reporters, BBC News
Phillip Hughes played in 26 Tests for Australia before his death at the age of 25
Phillip Hughes collapsed after being hit by a cricket ball at the top of his neck and the base of the skull.
One of the major arteries into the brain split and caused massive bleeding.
The brain is a very delicate and vulnerable organ, which is surrounded by the skull - a defensive wall of bone - and a cushioning fluid.
But it is not a simple case of the brain having specific weak spots.
""The brain is protected by the skull, but the upper neck is vulnerable,"" said Peter Hutchinson, a professor of neurosurgery at University of Cambridge.
He told the BBC: ""We evolved to enable a neck with a lot of movement, but the consequence is a risk of injury to the vessels from excessive movement or direct trauma.""
The vertebral arteries run up both sides of the neck and the blow from the ball caused a dissection, in which the artery ruptures.
Antonio Belli, professor of trauma neurosurgery at the University of Birmingham, said: ""The vertebral arteries supply the brain stem, which controls breathing and heart rhythm, so I think that could be why he stopped breathing immediately.""
How the brain is fed by arteries (in red) and veins (in blue) in the head and neck
Types of injury
While vertebral artery dissections are rare, there are two common types of brain injury known as ""focal"" and ""diffuse"".
Focal injuries tend to be caused by falls and assaults. They are the result of a damage to one area of the brain, which results in a blood clot.
This occupies space and causes pressure on the surrounding brain, starving the organ of oxygen leading to brain cells dying. It is treated by removing the clot.
However, damage may not be confined to just the site of the impact - known as a ""coup injury"".
The brain floats inside the skull so can collide with the side of the skull opposite the impact causing a ""contra-coup injury"".
The front of Olympic rower James Cracknell's brain was damaged when he was struck on the back of the head while cycling.
Widespread
The other class of injury is largely the result of high speed road accidents.

In diffuse injuries the damage is spread across the brain, which becomes swollen.
The pressure builds in the tight confines of the skull and the flow of blood can be impaired.
Treatment requires lowering the pressure in the brain.
It is also possible to damage the brain without a direct blow to the head.
The brain sits in fluid inside the skull and can bounce around if there is enough force.
In something like severe whiplash the brain can be shaken around the skull, even though no blow is delivered.
Mr Belli told the BBC: ""Often what does the damage is not the direct impact, but rotational forces.
""You could argue from an evolutionary point of view, we're well designed to withstand a direct blow, but not engineered well to withstand the rotational forces in a road traffic accident.""
Thinner walls
The skull itself does have stronger and weaker parts.
A region called the pterion, close to the ears, is the thinnest part of the skull so is most vulnerable to fracture.
But the relatively reinforced forehead and back of the skull can still be damaged.
""They may be thicker parts of the skull, but you can still fracture them if you transmit enough force,"" Prof Hutchinson noted.
""There isn't a safe point or a weak point, you get a lot of damage from the way the force travels through the head,"" added Mr Belli.
Lasting damage
Damage varies hugely from one patient to another - one patient who has a seemingly severe injury can show better recovery than injuries which appear minor.
Prof Hutchinson said it the lasting damage depended on where the damage was caused as ""some areas are more critical"".
""Bleeding in the motor cortex can result in paralysis while damage to the visual cortex would result in blindness.""
He said sport was not taking head injury seriously enough, but changes in American football were driving reform.
""In terms of sport, the most controversial is boxing because it is a deliberate act, horse riding creates a lot of serious injuries, and rugby increasingly so.
""There are racing drivers who have had an accident in the early part of the weekend, raced the whole weekend and not remembered a thing.""
""People need to be aware of brain injury.""

"244","How the West is cutting teen pregnancy","Is it true that one in three US teenagers gets pregnant?","How the West is cutting teen pregnancy
By Keith Moore BBC News
Christingle: The Christmas tradition that only got going in the 1960s
Teenage pregnancy is a problem developed Western nations have been battling for decades - and though it sometimes goes unnoticed they have made huge progress.
""Here's a story of utter irresponsibility: About one-third of American girls become pregnant as teenagers,"" wrote columnist Nicholas Kristof in the New York Times recently.
It seems like a shockingly high number. And eight years ago it was accurate.
In 2006, this was the cumulative risk of a teenager becoming pregnant once between the ages of 13 and 19. It was calculated by the National Campaign to Prevent Teen and Unplanned Pregnancy, a non-profit organisation, using data for births and abortions and an estimate for the number of miscarriages.
Truly one of the US's great success stories over the past two decades”
End Quote Bill Albert National Campaign to Prevent Teen and Unplanned Pregnancy
But when the same formula is used with the most recent figures, from 2010, it indicates that the number of teenage American girls becoming pregnant is now less than one in four, a reduction on track with changes over the past two decades.
Bill Albert, chief programme officer for the National Campaign, says teen pregnancy and birth rates have been declining in the US ""almost without interruptions"" for nearly 20 years, after peaking in the early 1990s.
They are down among all racial and ethnic groups in all 50 states.
He describes it as ""truly one of the US's great success stories over the past two decades"".
Indeed, the preliminary data for teen birth rates in 2013 suggests there has been another 22% drop in the rate of 15-to-19-year-olds giving birth since 2010.
Although abortion data is not yet available, Albert thinks it is highly likely that the rate of teenage pregnancy has declined from its 2010 level. It could be that less than a fifth of American teenage girls are now getting pregnant once.
""We do know that three things are happening in the US - the teen pregnancy rate is going down, the teen abortion rate is going down and the teen birth rate is going down,"" Albert says.
Why is this?
""Teen pregnancy drops in one of two ways - either teens are having less sex overall or the teens who are sexually active are using contraceptives and using them better,"" says Heather Boonstra from the Guttmacher Institute, a non-governmental organisation which researches sexual and reproductive health.
""What we have found looking back at just these two behaviours, is that overwhelmingly it is due to better contraceptive use.""
The reasons why people are using contraceptives better are not clear-cut, Boonstra says.
Colorado's birth control success
Reasons she cites include greater awareness of condoms following the aids crisis, changing norms about the age people in developed countries are getting married and having children (which lowers the planned pregnancy rate), and the internet making information more accessible.
When it comes to the influence of sex education in schools, Boonstra says that while there is evidence it has helped increase teenagers' use of contraception and lower their number of partners, it does not explain the declines in teenage pregnancy entirely.
""These declines have happened across all 50 states and here in the United States different states and different school districts have different policies about their sex education programmes, and so programmes are important but there's a lot more that's going on here because otherwise we would have seen variations across the nation,"" she says.
There has been conflicting research about whether reality TV programmes such as MTV's ""16 and Pregnant"" help prevent teenage pregnancy or glamorise it.
Despite teenage pregnancy in the US being at historic lows, it's still the case that a much higher proportion of US teenagers have babies than their counterparts in other countries in Western Europe - as Kristof points out.
Both Boonstra and Albert say there are various reasons for the higher US teenage birth rate, including less access to contraception, the US's racial and ethnic makeup, norms around the best times to start a family and the prevalence of abstinence-only sex education programmes in the US.
The reduction in the numbers of teenagers having children isn't just restricted to the US, says Prof Roger Ingham from the University of Southampton.
""In most of the countries in Western Europe, the rates have been going down steadily over the last few years,"" he says. The teenage pregnancy rate in the UK is the highest in Western Europe, which may explain why it has been faster in the UK than elsewhere.
Ingham, who advised the UK government for 12 years on its strategy to reduce teen pregnancy, says the declines are not due to teenagers having less sex.  As in the US, the improvement appears to be related to more widespread use of contraceptives, which Ingham says is due to better sex education in schools.
In terms of abortion impacting the birth rate, he says there is a mixed picture in the countries where there is good data.
The Netherlands has a low teenage abortion rate and a low conception rate, Ingham says, while Sweden has a similar birth rate but a higher conception rate - in other words, a higher proportion of pregnancies end in termination.
In the UK, the birth rate has gone down more quickly than the conception rate, as a higher proportion of those who are pregnant are choosing to have an abortion than in previous years.
